At 5 PM EDT,\\nthe center of Idalia was located over the eastern Gulf of Mexico about\\n280 miles south of Saint Marks Florida. Idalia is moving to the north\\nat 16 mph. Idalia now has top sustained winds of 100 mph. Additional\\nstrengthening is expected through tonight, and Idalia is expected to\\nbe a major hurricane at landfall along the Big Bend coast. Idalia is\\nexpected to be Category 3 hurricane at landfall and could possibly be\\na low-end Category 4.\\n\\nTo put this into historical context, there are NO major hurricanes in\\nthe historical dataset going back to 1851 that have tracked into\\nApalachee Bay. This has the makings of an unprecedented event for this\\npart of the state.\\n\\nYour final preparations should be rushed to completion by sunset this\\nevening. If you are under an evacuation order, leave as soon as\\npossible. Conditions will rapidly deteriorate late tonight and early\\nWednesday morning.\\n\\nLife-threatening and catastrophic storm surge is expected around the\\nshores of Apalachee Bay. From the Aucilla River to Yankeetown, storm\\nsurge inundation of 10 to 15 feet is possible. Storm surge will be\\nhighly dependent on the storm track, with the highest surge values\\nalong and to the right of where the center makes landfall. Storm surge\\nwill peak tonight and Wednesday.\\n\\nA Storm Surge Warning is in effect from Indian Pass to the Suwannee\\nRiver for the danger of life threatening inundation from rising water\\nmoving inland. Storm surge inundation above normally dry ground could\\nreach the following heights, if the peak surge occurs with high tide:\\n1 to 3 feet from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass, 3 to 5 feet from Indian\\nPass to Carrabelle, 4 to 7 feet from Carrabelle to the mouth of the\\nOchlockonee River, 7 to 11 feet from the Ochlockonee River to the\\nAucilla River, and 10 to 15 feet from the Aucilla River to the\\nSuwannee River. The deepest water will occur along the immediate\\ncoast, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous\\nwaves.\\n\\nA Hurricane Warning is in effect along the coast from Indian Pass to\\nthe Suwannee River, plus inland portions of the Florida Big Bend and\\nthe I-75 corridor of south Georgia. A Tropical Storm Warning is in\\neffect from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass, plus inland portions of\\nSouthwest Georgia as far northwest as Bainbridge, Camilla, and\\nSylvester.\\n\\nTropical storm force winds are most likely to arrive along the coast\\nafter midnight tonight, though brief increases to tropical storm force\\nin rain bands are possible starting early this evening. Preparations\\nfor Idalia need to be rushed to completion. Expect downed trees and\\npowerlines, possibly widespread in the Big Bend region, with prolonged\\npower outages possible. Ensure you have enough supplies to last for\\nseveral days.\\n\\nRainfall amounts will be heaviest along and east of the track of\\nIdalia, especially in the Florida Big Bend int south-central Georgia.\\n5 to 8 inches of rain are forecast, with isolated higher amounts\\npossible. This could lead to life threatening flash flooding. A Flood\\nWatch is now in effect from Gulf County, FL to Lee County, GA and all\\npoints eastward. River flooding is possible in the Ochlockonee,\\nAucilla, Saint Marks, and Suwannee basins, but fast forward motion of\\nthe storms will keep river flooding minor.\\n\\nSeveral tornadoes are possible in the outer rain bands starting\\ntonight and continuing into Wednesday. This will primarily be north\\nand east of the center.\\n\\nLife-threatening rip currents and high surf are expected along all\\nbeaches for at least the next couple days, well away from the center.\\nEveryone needs to stay out of the water.\\n\\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\\n-----------------\\n\\n* SURGE:\\nProtect against life-threatening surge having possible catastrophic\\nimpacts across the Big Bend coast. Potential impacts in this area\\ninclude:\\n- Widespread deep inundation, with storm surge flooding greatly\\naccentuated by powerful battering waves. Structural damage to\\nbuildings, with many washing away. Damage greatly compounded\\nfrom considerable floating debris. Locations may be\\nuninhabitable for an extended period.\\n- Near-shore escape routes and secondary roads washed out or\\nseverely flooded. Flood control systems and barriers may become\\nstressed.\\n- Extreme beach erosion. New shoreline cuts possible.\\n- Massive damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.\\nNumerous small craft broken away from moorings with many lifted\\nonshore and stranded.\\n\\nElsewhere across eastern Florida panhandle little to no impact is\\nanticipated.\\n\\n* WIND:\\nProtect against life-threatening wind having possible devastating\\nimpacts across the Florida Big Bend region and south-central Georgia.\\nPotential impacts in this area include:\\n- Structural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof\\nand wall failures. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage\\ngreatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles. Locations\\nmay be uninhabitable for weeks or months.\\n- Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\\nroadway signs blown over.\\n- Many roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\\nor heavily wooded places. Many bridges, causeways, and access\\nroutes impassable.\\n- Widespread power and communications outages.\\n\\n* FLOODING RAIN:\\n\\nAreas of flash and urban flooding, some of which may be locally\\nsignificant, are expected across portions of the Florida Big Bend, the\\neastern Panhandle, and southern Georgia through Wednesday.\\n\\n* TORNADOES:\\nA few tornadoes will be possible over the Florida Big Bend tonight, and\\nspreading into south Georgia Wednesday. Potential impacts include:\\n- The occurrence of scattered tornadoes can hinder the execution\\nof emergency plans during tropical events.\\n- Several places may experience tornado damage with a few spots\\nof considerable damage, power loss, and communications failures.\\n- Locations could realize roofs torn off frame houses, mobile homes\\ndemolished, boxcars overturned, large trees snapped or uprooted,\\nvehicles tumbled, and small boats tossed about. Dangerous\\nprojectiles can add to the toll.\\n\\nElsewhere across eastern Florida panhandle and southeastern Alabama,\\nlittle to no impact is anticipated.\\n\\nPRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n* EVACUATIONS:\\nListen to local official for recommended preparedness actions,\\nincluding possible evacuation. If ordered to evacuate, do so\\nimmediately.\\n\\nFor those not under evacuation orders, assess the risk from wind,\\nfalling trees, and flooding at your location. If you decide to move,\\nrelocate to a safer location nearby. If you do not relocate, help keep\\nroadways open for those under evacuation orders.\\n\\nIf evacuating, leave with a destination in mind and allow extra time\\nto get there. Take your emergency supplies kit. Gas up your vehicle\\nahead of time.\\n\\nLet others know where you are going prior to departure. Secure loose\\nitems and pets in the car, and avoid distracted driving.\\n\\nIf evacuating, follow designated evacuation routes. Seek traffic\\ninformation on roadway signs, the radio, and from official sources.\\n\\n\\n* OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION:\\nAll preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to\\ncompletion. Ensure you are in a safe location before the onset of\\nstrong winds or possible flooding.\\n\\nIf you are relocating to safe shelter, leave as early as possible.\\nAllow extra time to reach your destination. Many roads and bridges\\nwill be closed once strong winds arrive. Check the latest weather\\nforecast before departing and drive with caution.\\n\\nIf heading to a community shelter, become familiar with the shelter\\nrules before arrival, especially if you have special needs or have\\npets. Take essential items with you from your Emergency Supplies Kit.\\n\\nFailure to adequately shelter may result in serious injury or loss of\\nlife. Always heed the advice of local officials and comply with any\\norders that are issued. Remember, during the storm 9 1 1 Emergency\\nServices may not be able to immediately respond if conditions are\\nunsafe. This should be a big factor in your decision making.\\n\\nKeep cell phones well charged. Cell phone chargers for automobiles\\ncan be helpful, but be aware of your risk for deadly carbon monoxide\\npoisoning if your car is left idling in a garage or other poorly\\nventilated area.\\n\\nIf you are a visitor, be sure to know the name of the city in which\\nyou are staying and the name of the county in which it resides.\\nListen for these locations in local news updates. Pay attention for\\ninstructions from local authorities.\\n\\nStorm surge is the leading killer associated with tropical storms and\\nhurricanes! Make sure you are in a safe area away from the surge\\nzone. Even if you are not in a surge-prone area, you could find\\nyourself cutoff by flood waters during and after the storm. Heed\\nevacuation orders issued by the local authorities.\\n\\nRapidly rising flood waters are deadly. If you are in a flood-prone\\narea, consider moving to higher ground. Never drive through a flooded\\nroadway. Remember, turn around don't drown!\\n\\nIf a Tornado Warning is issued for your area, be ready to shelter\\nquickly, preferably away from windows and in an interior room not\\nprone to flooding. If driving, scan the roadside for quick shelter\\noptions.\\n\\nIf in a place that is vulnerable to high wind, such as near large\\ntrees, a manufactured home, upper floors of a high-rise building, or\\non a boat, consider moving to a safer shelter before the onset of\\nstrong winds or flooding.\\n\\nClosely monitor weather.gov, NOAA Weather radio or local news outlets\\nfor official storm information. Be ready to adapt to possible changes\\nto the forecast. Ensure you have multiple ways to receive weather\\nwarnings.\\n\\n* ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION:\\n- For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov\\n- For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org\\n\\nNEXT UPDATE\\n-----------\\n\\nThe next local statement will be issued by the National Weather\\nService in Tallahassee FL around 1130 PM EDT, or sooner if conditions\\nwarrant.\", starts='2023-08-29T17:35:00-04:00', expires='2023-08-30T01:45:00-04:00'),\n",
