National	6/29/2023	English	Air Quality Alert	Protecting Yourself from Poor Air Quality Answering FAQs to help you understand AQI  Topics: Health & Wellness Climate Change Outdoor Air This summer, Canada is experiencing a severe wildfire season that has forced thousands of people from their homes across a number of provinces. Earlier in June, weather conditions caused a haze of smoke to sweep across Canada and the Eastern United States. Now, more wildfire smoke is again clouding the skies, making air quality unhealthy in several states. In fact, Chicago, Detroit and New York have all experienced Air Quality Index (AQI) levels that were among the highest in the world at the time due to particle pollution from the smoke.  Sign up for email Get the latest news in clean air and lung health directly to your inbox. In addition, hot summer temperatures can add to the air quality problem. This is because heat and stagnant air during a heat wave can lead to ground level ozone pollution to build up. Climate change is leading both to more particle pollution from wildfire smoke and to more ozone pollution as well as more days with extreme heat.  Unhealthy air quality can be scary, but the Air Quality Index is a valuable tool to help you stay safe. Here is some essential information to help you use it.  What is Air Quality Index (AQI)? The AQI is a rating system that shows the severity of pollution in the air on a scale from 0 to 500. It’s a complex calculation that is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The rating is created by measuring five major pollutants: ground-level ozone, particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Ground-level ozone and particulate matter, or particle pollution, are the two air pollutants that are most widespread and pose the greatest risk to our health. Those measurements are then calculated into the 0-500 scale to give you one number that reflects how healthy the air is to breathe that day. Particle pollution from wildfire smoke is driving the high AQIs experienced by Chicago, New York City, and so many other cities this summer.  What is considered good and bad AQI? An AQI under 50 is considered good air quality, meaning that it is safe for everyone to spend time outdoors without posing a risk to their health. As the AQI number increases however, so does the risk to health. An AQI over 300 is considered hazardous. Consult the chart below for more in-depth explanations:  Daily AQI Color        Levels of Concern        Values of index        Description of Air Quality  Green Good 0 to 50        Air quality is satisfactory, and air pollution poses little to no risk. Yellow Moderate 51 to 100        Air quality is acceptable. However, there may be a risk for some people, particularly those who are unusually sensitive to air pollution. Orange Unhealthy for Sensitive groups 101 to 150        Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is less likely to be affected. Red Unhealthy 151 to 200         Some members of the general public may experience health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects. Purple         Very Unhealthy 201 to 300        Health alert: The risk of health effects is increased for everyone. Maroon         Hazardous 300 or higher Health warning of emergency conditions: everyone is more likely to be affected. Who is considered in a sensitive group? High risk groups include children under 18, the elderly, people with chronic heart or lung disease, pregnant people, and people with diabetes. Adults who are active outdoors, including outdoor workers and avid exercisers, can be considered at higher risk as well because of prolonged exposure. All these groups are most likely to be the first to experience the effects of ozone and particle pollution, so they need to take extra steps to protect themselves from harm.  Contact your healthcare provider if: Symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, runny nose, sore throat, headaches, extreme fatigue, shortness of breathe or any difficulty breathing may signal a more serious problem. What can you do to stay safe from poor air quality? Air pollution can threaten anyone's health, so stay up to date on the AQI in your area. AQI forecasts and real-time information can be found on EPA’s AirNow Website. AQI values at or below 100 are generally thought of as satisfactory but be aware of how you feel and take steps to help protect yourself whenever needed.   On days when the air quality is orange, red, purple or maroon:  Reduce the time you spend outdoors to under 30 minutes when AQI is high. Also, reduce the intensity of outdoor activity. According to the EPA, the chances of being affected by unhealthy levels of air pollution increase the longer a person is active outdoors and the more strenuous the activity.  If you must go outdoors, consider wearing a mask. Unfortunately, not all masks are created equal when it comes to particle pollution as a cloth or dust mask are not able to filter out the fine particles. However, well-fitted N95 or KN95 masks have better filtration capabilities and may be beneficial during high AQI days. Keep your air indoors healthy by keeping the windows and doors closed. Run the air conditioning on the recirculate setting, use a portable HEPA air cleaner or, in severe circumstances, creating a clean room. Check out other clean air resources on our website.
airnow.gov	https://www.airnow.gov/air-quality-and-health/fires-and-your-health/	National	NA	English	Air Quality Alert	Fires and Your Health Smoke is made up of a complex mixture of gases and fine particles produced when wood and other organic materials burn. The biggest health threat from smoke is from fine particles. These microscopic particles can get into your eyes and respiratory system, where they can cause health problems such as burning eyes, runny nose, and illnesses such as bronchitis. Fine particles also can aggravate chronic heart and lung diseases - and even are linked to premature deaths in people with these conditions.  If you are healthy, you're usually not at a major risk from short-term exposures to smoke. Still, it's a good idea to avoid breathing smoke if you can help it. Everyone should take the steps below when wildfires are present.  Use common sense. If it looks smoky outside, it's probably not a good time to mow the lawn or go for a run. And it's probably not a good time for your children to play outdoors.  Pay attention to local air quality reports. Stay alert to smoke-related news coverage or health warnings.  Visit AirNow to find out the Air Quality Index in your area. As smoke gets worse, the amount of particles in the air changes - and so do the steps you should take to protect yourself. AirNow recommends precautions you can take to protect your health when air pollution gets bad.  If you are advised to stay indoors, take steps to keep indoor air as clean as possible. When smoke levels are high, try to avoid using anything that burns, such as wood fireplaces, gas logs, gas stoves - and even candles! Don't vacuum. That stirs up particles already inside your home. And don't smoke. That puts even more pollution in your lungs, and in the lungs of people around you.  If you have asthma or other lung disease, make sure you follow your doctor's directions about taking your medicines and following your asthma management plan. Call your doctor if your symptoms worsen.  Run your air conditioner if you have one. Keep the fresh air intake closed and the filter clean to prevent bringing additional smoke inside. Note: If you don't have an air conditioner, staying inside with the windows closed may be dangerous in extremely hot weather. In these cases, seek alternative shelter.  If you have heart or lung disease, if you are an older adult, or if you have children, talk with your doctor about whether and when you should leave the area. When smoke is heavy for a prolonged period of time, fine particles can build up indoors, even though you may not be able to see them.  To track wildfires across the U.S., go to Fire and Smoke Map.

National Weather Service	https://www.weather.gov/safety/airquality	National	NA	English	Air Quality Alert	Safety  National Program  Why Air Quality Is Important  Air Quality Resources Air Quality SafetyAirNow Air Quality ForecastAir Quality Awareness Week!Hourly Air Quality ForecastWildfire Smoke Health ConcernsWildfire SafetyVolcanic Ash SafetyEducation and Outreach MaterialsLinks and Partners Share your Story The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), issues daily air quality forecast guidance as part of a national Air Quality Forecasting Capability. Air quality has improved significantly since the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970; however, there are still many areas of the country where the public is exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollutants and sensitive ecosystems are damaged by air pollution. Poor air quality is responsible for an estimated more than 100,000 premature deaths in the United States each year. Costs from air pollution-related illness are estimated at $150 billion per year. The goal of the U.S. air quality program is to provide ozone, particulate matter and other pollutant forecasts the public can use to limit the harmful effects of poor air quality. Our goal is to save and improve lives and reduce the number of air quality-related asthma attacks; eye, nose, and throat irritation; heart attacks and other respiratory and cardiovascular problems.  Risks Related to Ground Level Ozone Ground-level ozone (O3) is a product of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of heat and sunlight. Motor vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, gasoline vapors, and chemical solvents are among the major sources of NOx and VOCs responsible for harmful buildup of ground-level ozone. Even at low concentrations, ozone can trigger a variety of health problems such as lung irritation and inflammation, asthma attacks, wheezing, coughing, and increased susceptibility to respiratory illnesses.  Risks Related to Particulate Matter Particulate matter (PM), or airborne particles, includes dust, dirt, soot, and smoke. Some particles are directly emitted into the air by cars, trucks, buses factories, construction sites and wood burning to name a few examples. Other particles are formed in the air when gases from burning fuels react with sunlight and water vapor. Such gases, from incomplete combustion in motor vehicles, at power plants and in other industrial processes, contribute indirectly to particulate pollution. This pollution can cause chronic bronchitis, asthma attacks, decreased lung function, coughing, painful breathing, cardiac problems and heart attacks, as well as a variety of serious environmental impacts such as acidification of lakes and streams and nutrient depletion in soils and water bodies.

It tells you how clean or polluted your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for you. The AQI focuses on health effects you may experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air. EPA calculates the AQI for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-level ozone, particle pollution (also known as particulate matter), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. For each of these pollutants, EPA has established national air quality standards to protect public health .Ground-level ozone and airborne particles are the two pollutants that pose the greatest threat to human health in this country.
ready.gov	https://www.ready.gov/pets	National	6/16/2023	English	Disaster	Prepare Your Pets for Disasters Your pets are an important member of your family, so they need to be included in your family’s emergency plan. To prepare for the unexpected follow these tips with your pets in mind:  Make a plan. Build an emergency kit. Stay informed. Make a Plan If you have a plan in place for you and your pets, you will likely encounter less difficulty, stress and worry when you need to make a decision during an emergency. If local officials ask you to evacuate, that means your pet should evacuate too. If you leave your pets behind, they may end up lost, injured or worse.  Things to include in your plan:  Have an evacuation plan for your pet. Many public shelters and hotels do not allow pets inside. Know a safe place where you can take your pets before disasters and emergencies happen. Develop a buddy system. Plan with neighbors, friends or relatives to make sure that someone is available to care for or evacuate your pets if you are unable to do so. Have your pet microchipped. Make sure to keep your address and phone number up-to-date and include contact information for an emergency contact outside of your immediate area. Contact your local emergency management office, animal shelter or animal control office to get additional advice and information if you’re unsure how to care for your pet in case of an emergency. Build a Kit for Your Pet Just as you do with your family’s emergency supply kit, think first about the basics for survival, such as food and water. Have two kits, one larger kit if you are sheltering in place and one lightweight version for if you need to evacuate.  Review your kits regularly to ensure that their contents, especially foods and medicines, are fresh.  Here are some items you may want to include in an emergency kit for your pet:  Image illustration of a dog and an emergency supply kit for pets, which includes food, toys, medicine, food and a collar with a tag.  Food. Keep several days’ supply of food in an airtight, waterproof container. Water. Store a water bowl and several days’ supply of water. Medicine. Keep an extra supply of the medicine your pet takes on a regular basis in a waterproof container. First aid kit. Talk to your veterinarian about what is most appropriate for your pet’s emergency medical needs. Collar with ID tag and a harness or leash. Include a backup leash, collar and ID tag. Have copies of your pet’s registration information and other relevant documents in a waterproof container and available electronically. Traveling bag, crate or sturdy carrier, ideally one for each pet. Grooming items. Pet shampoo, conditioner and other items, in case your pet needs some cleaning up. Sanitation needs. Include pet litter and litter box (if appropriate), newspapers, paper towels, plastic trash bags and household chlorine bleach to provide for your pet’s sanitation needs. A picture of you and your pet together. If you become separated from your pet during an emergency, a picture of you and your pet together will help you document ownership and allow others to assist you in identifying your pet. Familiar items. Put favorite toys, treats or bedding in your kit. Familiar items can help reduce stress for your pet. Tips for Large Animals alert - info If you have pets such as horses, goats or pigs on your property, be sure to prepare before a disaster.  In addition to the tips above:  Ensure all animals have some form of identification. Evacuate animals earlier, whenever possible. Map out primary and secondary routes in advance. Make available vehicles and trailers needed for transporting and supporting each type of animal. Also make available experienced handlers and drivers. Ensure destinations have food, water, veterinary care and handling equipment. If evacuation is not possible, animal owners must decide whether to move large animals to a barn or turn them loose outside. Stay Informed Being prepared and staying informed of current conditions. Here are some ways you can stay informed:  Pay attention to wireless emergency alerts for local alerts and warnings sent by state and local public safety officials. Listen to local officials when told to evacuate or shelter in place. Download the FEMA app and get weather alerts from the National Weather Service, for up to five different locations anywhere in the United States. Always bring pets indoors at the first sign or warning of a storm or disaster.

Es por esto por lo que deben ser incluidos en la planificación familiar para emergencias. Siga los siguientes consejos mientras piensa en sus mascotas para estar preparado para lo inesperado:  Haga un plan. Prepare un kit de suministros de emergencia. Manténgase informado. Haga un Plan Si tiene un plan para usted y sus mascotas, probablemente encontrará menos dificultades, estrés y preocupación cuando tenga que tomar una decisión durante una emergencia. Si las autoridades locales le ordenan a desalojar o evacuar, eso significa que su mascota también debe hacerlo. Si deja a sus mascotas, pueden acabar perdidas, heridas o algo peor.  Detalles que debe incluir en su plan:  Tenga un plan de desalojo o evacuación para sus mascotas. Muchos refugios públicos y hoteles no permiten que las mascotas se alojen. Conozca sobre algún lugar seguro a donde pueda llevar a sus mascotas desde antes que ocurran las emergencias y desastres. Desarrolle un sistema de amigos. Planifique con vecinos, amigos o familiares para asegurarse de que alguien esté disponible para cuidar o desalojar a sus mascotas en caso de que usted no pueda hacerlo. Coloque un microchip en su mascota. Asegúrese de mantener su dirección y número telefónico actualizado e incluya la información de algún contacto que viva afuera de su área en caso de emergencia. Comuníquese con la oficina local para el manejo de emergencias, albergue de mascotas o de control de animales para obtener más consejos o información en caso de que usted no esté seguro de cómo cuidar a sus mascotas si ocurre una emergencia. Prepare un kit para sus animales Así como piensa en el kit de suministros de emergencia para su familia, es importante pensar en las cosas básicas que su mascota necesita para sobrevivir, como comida y agua. Tenga dos kits, uno más grande si se refugia en su hogar y una versión más ligera por si necesita desalojar. Revise sus kits regularmente para asegurarse de que sus contenidos, especialmente comida y medicamentos, estén en buenas condiciones.  En esta lista encontrará algunos artículos que debería incluir en el kit de emergencia de su mascota:  Image illustration of a dog and an emergency supply kit for pets, which includes food, toys, medicine, food and a collar with a tag.

Una fotografía de ustedes en compañía de su mascota. Si se llegara a separar de su mascota, esa fotografía ayudará a documentar que usted es el dueño de la mascota y permitirá que otros puedan ayudarle. Artículos familiares. Agregue juguetes, meriendas o antojos y una cama en su kit, esto ayudará a reducir el estrés de su mascota. Consejos para la protección de animales grandes alert - info Si tiene animales grandes como caballos, cabras o cerdos en su propiedad, asegúrese de prepararse antes de un desastre.  Además de los consejos anteriores:  Asegúrese de que todos los animales tengan algún tipo de identificación. Evacúe a los animales siempre que sea posible. Prepare mapas de rutas principales y alternativas con anticipación. Tenga los vehículos y remolques necesarios para transportar y soportar a cada tipo de animal. También tenga a disposición arrieros y choferes experimentados. Asegúrese de que los lugares de destino tengan comida, agua, cuidado veterinario y equipo de manejo. Si no es posible desalojar, los dueños de animales deben decidir si trasladan a los animales grandes a un refugio o si los liberan al aire libre. Manténgase informado  Esté preparado y manténgase informado sobre las condiciones en curso. A continuación, algunas maneras sobre cómo puede mantenerse informado:  Preste atención al sistema de alertas de emergencia para recibir alertas y avisos emitidos por los funcionarios estatales o locales de seguridad pública. Siga las indicaciones de los funcionarios locales cuando emitan ordenes de desalojo o de refugiarse en el lugar. Descargue la aplicación móvil de FEMA y obtenga alertas climatológicas del Servicio Meteorológico Nacional, para hasta cinco ubicaciones en cualquier parte de los Estados Unidos.

Red Cross	https://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/recovering-emotionally.html	National	NA	English	Disaster	Recovering Emotionally After a Disaster To reach out for free 24/7 counseling or support, call or text the Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990.  Disasters are upsetting experiences for everyone involved. Children, senior citizens, people with disabilities and people for whom English is not their first language are especially at risk and are likely to need extra care and help. But everyone, even the people that others look up to for guidance and assistance, is entitled to their feelings and deserves support throughout the recovery process.  Emotional Responses When we experience a disaster or other stressful life event, we can have a variety of reactions, all of which can be common responses to difficult situations.  These reactions can include:  Feeling physically and mentally drained Having difficulty making decisions or staying focused on topics Becoming easily frustrated on a more frequent basis Arguing more with family and friends Feeling tired, sad, numb, lonely or worried Experiencing changes in appetite or sleep patterns    Most of these reactions are temporary and will go away over time. Try to accept whatever reactions you may have. Look for ways to take one step at a time and focus on taking care of your disaster-related needs and those of your family.  Keep a particularly close eye on the children in your family. When disaster strikes, a child's view of the world as a safe and predictable place is temporarily lost. Children of different ages react in different ways to trauma, but how parents and other adults react following any traumatic event can help children recover more quickly and more completely. Your local Red Cross can give you information about helping children cope with disaster and trauma.  Recovery Takes Time Getting ourselves and our lives back in a routine that is comfortable for us takes time.  Take care of your safety. Find a safe place to stay and make sure your physical health needs and those of your family are addressed. Seek medical attention if necessary. Limit your exposure to the sights and sounds of disaster, especially on television, the radio and in the newspapers. Eat healthy. During times of stress, it is important that you maintain a balanced diet and drink plenty of water. Get some rest. With so much to do, it may be difficult to have enough time to rest or get adequate sleep. Giving your body and mind a break can boost your ability to cope with the stress you may be experiencing. Stay connected with family and friends. Giving and getting support is one of the most important things you can do. Try to do something as a family that you have all enjoyed in the past. Be patient with yourself and with those around you. Recognize that everyone is stressed and may need some time to put their feelings and thoughts in order. That includes you! Set priorities. Tackle tasks in small steps. Gather information about assistance and resources that will help you and your family members meet your disaster-related needs. Stay positive. Remind yourself of how you’ve successfully gotten through difficult times in the past. Reach out when you need support, and help others when they need it. When the Challenges Are Ongoing Many people have experience coping with stressful life events and typically feel better after a few days. Others find that their stress does not go away as quickly as they would like and it influences their relationships with their family, friends and others.  If you find yourself or a loved one experiencing some of the feelings and reactions listed below for two weeks or longer, this may be a sign that you need to reach out for additional assistance.  Crying spells or bursts of anger Difficulty eating Difficulty sleeping Losing interest in things Increased physical symptoms sucha as headaches or stomachaches Fatigue Feeling guilty, helpless or hopeless Avoiding family and friends Children and Disasters Children experience traumatic events differently. Experiencing a disaster can leave children feeling frightened, confused and insecure, particularly if this experience is not their first.  Because they can’t always talk about their worries, it sometimes comes out in a child’s behavior. Some may react immediately; others may be fine for weeks or months and then show troubling behavior. Knowing the signs that are common at different ages can help parents recognize problems and respond accordingly.  They may be more agitated or act out They may be more clingy or cry often They may need more attention or reassurance from adults they trust Scary memories become attached to the sounds, sights and smells that happen at the time of the experience. It’s important to remind children that they are remembering the scary thing that happened; that it is not happening now.    Here are a few tips for talking to children after a traumatic event:  Provide children with opportunities to talk Don’t be afraid to admit you don’t have all the answers Allow kids to discuss their fears and concerns Answer questions appropriate for their age    Click here to learn more about how to build resilience in children through coping skills.  Coping with Disasters During the Holidays Disasters are stressful, especially during the holidays.   The good news is that stress after a disaster or during the holidays is common and usually temporary. Also, we all have experience coping with stressful events and can usually “bounce back” after difficult times.  Here is some information on disaster reactions and tips for taking care of the emotional health of you, your family and friends during the holidays.  Each positive action you take can help you feel better and more in control. What You May Be Feeling Now When recovering from a disaster, especially during the holidays, we can have a variety of reactions, all of which are common. Most of these reactions are temporary and will go away over time. Try to accept whatever reactions you may have. Look forward, one small step at a time, and focus on taking care of your needs and those of your friends and family.  These reactions can inlude:  Feeling sad that a normally joyful time of the year now feels burdened with trying to find a new home or with memories of a lost loved one Feeling lonely, especially when holiday sights and sounds remind us of happier times or of those we will be missing from this year’s rituals Feeling overwhelmed or unable to plan daily activities, including holiday activities Feeling physically and mentally drained Having difficulty making decisions or staying focused on tasks at hand Becoming easily frustrated with daily tasks or with family and friends Arguing more with those around us Feeling tired, numb, or worried Experiencing changes in appetite or sleep patterns Increasing alcohol or substance use Children can experience all of the reactions above, but they can also resume earlier behaviors (e.g., thumb-sucking or bed-wetting or “acting out”)  Click to access this information in printable format. Taking Action Take care of your safety. Focus first on ensuring you have a safe place to stay and that your physical needs are met.  Eat healthy. Maintain a balanced diet and drink plenty of water. Too much holiday “cheer” can increase your stress.  Get some rest. With so much to do, it can be difficult to rest or get adequate sleep. Giving your body and mind a break can boost your ability to cope with stress.  Reach out to others. If you find yourself in new surroundings, reach out to those around you. Giving and receiving support is important.  Be patient with yourself and with those around you.

Remove any remaining water, large amounts of dirt/mud, damaged items and other trash. Clean hard surfaces throughout your home (flooring, countertops and appliances) thoroughly with hot water and soap or a detergent. Then disinfect with bleach or a commercial disinfectant (be sure to follow directions on the bottle). Dry soft surfaces (upholstered furniture, rugs, bedding and clothing) in the open air if possible, before cleaning Throw out all food, beverages and medicine exposed to flood waters and mud. When in doubt, throw it out. This includes canned goods, plastic utensils, baby bottle nipples and containers with food or liquid that has been sealed shut. Any appliances that were inundated by flood water should be checked by a professional before you use them. Cleaning and sanizing food contact surfaces:  Throw away wooden cutting boards, wood or plastic utensils, and baby bottle nipples and pacifiers that have come into contact with floodwater. Use hot, soapy water to thoroughly wash metal pans, ceramic dishes and utensils that have come into contact with floodwater. Sanitize dishes by boiling them in a clean or properly treated water or by immersing them for 10 to 15 min in a solution of 1 tablespoons of unscented liquid of unscented liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water. Water Damage Water damage wall Water damage, such as from a flood or in the aftermath of a fire, is not just unsightly and unsanitary – it can also be dangerous. From wallboards to rugs, items that are not thoroughly dried can sprout mold and mildew.  Your first task in addressing water damage is to remove any water that remains. That means pumping out standing water and drying out waterlogged surfaces.  Pump out flooded basements gradually (about one-third of the water per day) to avoid structural damage. If the water is pumped out completely in a short period of time, pressure from water-saturated soil on the outside could cause basement walls to collapse. Bring all soft items (such as sofas, clothing, bedding, and throw rugs) outside if possible – sunlight and wind will help them dry faster. Throw out items that have absorbed water and cannot be cleaned or disinfected. This includes mattresses, carpeting, cosmetics, stuffed animals and baby toys. Remove all drywall and insulation that has been in contact with flood waters. Consider removing vinyl floor coverings and tile to allow the substructures beneath or behind them to dry. Keep the windows open and run fans – or keep them shut and run dehumidifiers – to pull moisture out of wood floors and subfloors, beams, doors, etc.    Be patient. Depending on the level of water damage incurred, it can take weeks or months for your home’s structural elements to be thoroughly dried. Only then should you replace drywall, carpets and other floorcoverings. Smoke Damage Fire damaged teddy bear Smoke odors and soot are difficult to remove, so the work may be best handled by professional fire restorers. However, there are some steps you can take to rid your home of these reminders of the fire. Most of all: avoid touching soot. It smears easily and will leave oily black stains on everything it touches. If one is available, use a shop vac to remove soot, being careful that the vacuum nozzle doesn’t contact the surface you are cleaning. If you have soot stains on your walls or hard surfaces, visit your local home improvement center to find a cleaner designed to address soot. For smoke odors, ventilation is key. Open windows and run fans. Don’t neglect your attic and other insulated spaces, since insulation often retains odors. Wash hard surfaces with hot soapy water. Consider using trisodium phosphate (TSP) if it is available where you live. Be sure to follow directions for safe use and disposal of TSP! For soft, washable items, such as clothing and bedding, first decide if the item is worth keeping. Smoke is difficult to fully remove, and you may have more important things to spend time on. Multiple wash cycles – without letting the items dry in between – may be required.

Generators should be used at least 20 feet away from your home. Identify and throw away food that may not be safe to eat. Check with local authorities to be sure your water is safe. In hot weather, stay cool and drink plenty of fluids to prevent heat-related illness. In cold weather, wear layers of clothing, which help to keep in body heat. Avoid downed power lines, if a power line falls on a car, you should stay inside the vehicle. CDC offers these tips to help you prepare for and cope with sudden loss of power.  Food Safety If the power is out for less than 4 hours, then the food in your refrigerator and freezer will be safe to consume. While the power is out, keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to keep food cold for longer. Visit Keep Food Safe After a Disaster or Emergency for more information.  Top of Page  Water Running from a Faucet Safe Drinking Water When power goes out, water purification systems may not be functioning fully. Safe water for drinking, cooking, and personal hygiene includes bottled, boiled, or treated water. Your state, local, or tribal health department can make specific recommendations for boiling or treating water in your area. For more information, visit Use Safe Water After a Disaster or Emergency.  Top of Page  Medications Some drugs require refrigeration to keep their strength, including many liquid drugs.  When the power is out for a day or more, throw away any medication that should be refrigerated, unless the drug’s label says otherwise. If a life depends on the refrigerated drug, but the medications have been at room temperature, use them only until a new supply is available. Replace all refrigerated drugs as soon as possible. Resources for people with chronic disease or disability.  Top of Page  Extreme Heat and Cold Heat Be aware of yours and others’ risk for heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heat cramps and fainting. To avoid heat stress, you should follow CDC’s heat safety tips.  Heat stroke is the most serious heat illness. It happens when the body can’t control its own temperature and its temperature rises rapidly. Sweating fails and the body cannot cool down. Body temperature may rise to 106°F or higher within 10 to 15 minutes. Heat stroke can cause death or permanent disability if emergency care is not given. Visit Warning Signs and Symptoms of Heat-Related Illness for more information on how to recognize symptoms and what to do if someone develops a heat-related illness.  If air conditioning is not available in your home:  Contact your local health department or locate an air-conditioned shelter in your area. Spend some time at a shopping mall or public library- even a few hours spent in air conditioning can help. Take cool showers or baths. Don’t rely solely on fans to keep you cool. While electric fans might provide some comfort, when temperatures are really hot, they won’t prevent heat-related illness. For more information on heat-related illnesses and treatment, see the CDC Extreme Heat Web site. Information for workers can be found on the NIOSH Web page Protecting Workers from Heat Illness.  These resources also provide information about extreme heat:  Heat Stress National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Comprehensive heat-induced occupational illness and injury information. Cold Hypothermia happens when a person’s core body temperature is lower than 35°C (95°F). Learn more about how to recognize and prevent hypothermia.  Top of Page  First Aid for Electrical Shock If you believe someone has been electrocuted take the following steps:  Look first. Don’t touch. The person may still be in contact with the electrical source. Touching the person may pass the current through you. Call or have someone else call 911 or emergency medical help. Turn off the source of electricity if possible. If not, move the source away from you and the affected person using a nonconducting object made of cardboard, plastic or wood. Once the person is free of the source of electricity, check the person’s breathing and pulse. If either has stopped or seems dangerously slow or shallow, begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) immediately. If the person is faint or pale or shows other signs of shock, lay the person down with the head slightly lower than the trunk of his or her body and the legs elevated. Don’t touch burns, break blisters, or remove burned clothing. Electrical shock may cause burns inside the body, so be sure the person is taken to a doctor. Top of Page  Power Line Hazards and Cars Downed Power Pole and Power Lines If a power line falls on a car, you should stay inside the vehicle. This is the safest place to stay. Warn people not to touch the car or the line. Call or ask someone to call the local utility company and emergency services.  The only circumstance in which you should consider leaving a car that is in contact with a downed power line is if the vehicle catches on fire. Open the door. Do not step out of the car. You may receive a shock. Instead, jump free of the car so that your body clears the vehicle before touching the ground. Once you clear the car, shuffle at least 50 feet away, with both feet on the ground.  As in all power line related emergencies, call for help immediately by dialing 911 or call your electric utility company’s Service Center/Dispatch Office.  Do not try to help someone else from the car while you are standing on the ground.

Top of Page  Dangers of Gasoline Siphoning Gasoline may be in short supply, before, during, and after natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods. When there is not enough gasoline, people may want to take gasoline from one container and put it into another. This can be done by siphoning.  Siphoning gasoline can harm your health. Do not try to siphon gasoline. It can cause serious injury or illness. Siphoning is when you use your mouth or a pump to suck a liquid such as gasoline out of one container, such as a gas tank, through a funnel or tube and into another container Possible injuries and illness from any form of siphoning include: Burns and injury from unintentional combustion of gasoline and/or gasoline vapors. This may happen if the gasoline or its vapors come into contact with a lit cigarette or static electricity. Confusion, drowsiness, headache or problems concentrating from breathing gasoline vapors Irritation of skin, eye or mucus membranes on contact Other possible injuries and illness from siphoning when you use your mouth for suction include: Lung damage, if gasoline is inhaled into the lungs (aspiration) during mouth-based siphoning Gastrointestinal (GI) signs and symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and stomach pain if any gasoline is swallowed Irritation of mucous membranes inside your mouth, throat and stomach on contact If you do breath gasoline fumes or swallow gasoline and feel ill, see a doctor and/or call the poison center for help at 1-800-222-1222 Top of Page  Safety at Work During Power Recovery As power returns after an outage, people at work may be at risk of electrical or traumatic injuries as power lines are reenergized and equipment is reactivated. CDC recommends that employers and employees be aware of those risks and take protective steps if they are in contact with or in proximity to power lines, electrical components, and the moving parts of heavy machinery.  More information on electrical safety is available in our fact sheet on Worker Safety in a Power Outage and Electrical Safety [NIOSH].  Top of Page  Be Prepared for an Emergency CDC recommends that people make an emergency plan that includes a disaster supply kit. This kit should include enough water, dried and canned food, and emergency supplies (flashlights, batteries, first-aid supplies, prescription medicines, and a digital thermometer) to last at least 3 days. Use battery-powered flashlights and lanterns, rather than candles, gas lanterns, or torches (to minimize the risk of fire).

Red Cross	https://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/safety-immediate-aftermath.html	National	NA	English	Disaster, Earthquake Warning	Staying Safe After a Disaster Although each type of disaster brings its own unique challenges, the steps listed here are applicable to many different situations you may face. For information on safety and recovery after specific types of disasters and emergencies, please visit our Disaster and Safety Library.     Check the area around you for safety. In the case of biological, chemical or radiological threats, listen for instructions on local radio or television stations about safe places to go. Have injuries treated by a medical professional. Wash small wounds with soap and water. To help prevent infection of small wounds, use bandages and replace them if they become soiled, damaged or waterlogged. Some natural hazards, like severe storms or earthquakes, may recur in the form of new storms or aftershocks over the next several days. Take all safety precautions if the hazard strikes again. For an earthquake aftershock, remember to DROP, COVER and HOLD ON just like you did during the initial earthquake. Avoid using the telephone (cellular or landlines) if a large number of homes in your area have been affected by a disaster. Emergency responders need to have the telephone lines available to coordinate their response. During the immediate post-disaster time period, only use the telephone to report life-threatening conditions and call your out-of-town emergency contact. Remain calm. Pace yourself. You may find yourself in the position of taking charge of other people. Listen carefully to what people are telling you, and deal patiently with urgent situations first If you had to leave your home, return only when local authorities advise that it is safe to do so. Also, be sure to have photo identification available, because sometimes local authorities will only permit people who own property in a disaster-affected area back into the area. Except in extreme emergencies or unless told to do so by emergency officials, avoid driving during the immediate post-disaster period. Keep roads clear for rescue and emergency vehicles. If you must drive, do not drive on roads covered with water. They could be damaged or eroded. Additionally, vehicles can begin to float in as little as six inches of water. Vehicles such as trucks and SUVs have larger tires and are more buoyant. However, even though these vehicles are heavier than a standard sedan, the buoyancy caused by the larger amount of air in their tires actually makes these vehicles more likely to float in water than smaller vehicles. If the disaster was widespread, listen to your radio or television station for instructions from local authorities. Information may change rapidly after a widespread disaster, so continue to listen regularly for updates. If the power is still out, listen to a battery-powered radio, television or car radio. If the area was flooded and children are present, warn them to stay away from storm drains, culverts and ditches. Children can get caught and injured in these areas.
National Weather Service	https://www.weather.gov/safety/wind-dust-storm	National	NA	English	Dust Storm Warning	Dust storms and Haboobs can occur anywhere in the United States but are most common in the Southwest. Haboobs occur as a result of thunderstorm outflow winds. Strong thunderstorm winds can start a dust storm that can drastically reduce visibility. Your NWS Forecast Office will issue a Dust Storm Warning if one is happening in your area.  Motorists Beware! A dust storm usually arrives suddenly in the form of an advancing wall of dust and debris which may be miles long and several thousand feet high. They strike with little warning, making driving conditions hazardous. Blinding, choking dust can quickly reduce visibility, causing accidents that may involve chain collisions, creating massive pileups. Dust storms usually last only a few minutes, but the actions a motorist takes during the storm may be the most important of his or her life.  Dust Storm Safety Tips If dense dust is observed blowing across or approaching a roadway, pull your vehicle off the pavement as far as possible, stop, turn off lights, set the emergency brake, take your foot off of the brake pedal to be sure the tail lights are not illuminated. Don't enter the dust storm area if you can avoid it. If you can't pull off the roadway, proceed at a speed suitable for visibility, turn on lights and sound horn occasionally. Use the painted center line to help guide you. Look for a safe place to pull off the roadway. Never stop on the traveled portion of the roadway. Lights Out! In the past, motorists driving in dust storms have pulled off the roadway, leaving lights on. Vehicles approaching from the rear and using the advance car's lights as a guide have inadvertently left the roadway and in some instances collided with the parked vehicle. Make sure all of your lights are off when you park off the roadway.
Arizona Emergency Information Network	https://ein.az.gov/hazards/dust-storms	Arizona	NA	English	Dust Storm Warning, Wind Advisory	Dust Storms Thunderstorms frequently produce strong winds that can blow loose sand and dirt from the ground, causing a large wall of dust and debris, or a dust storm.  Dust storms (also called “haboobs”) are unexpected, unpredictable and can sweep across Arizona's desert landscape at any time. Dust storms can be miles long and thousands of feet high. You can endure these brief but powerful windstorms if you know how to react.   BEFORE  Dust storms can reduce visibility to near zero in seconds, resulting in deadly, multi-vehicle accidents on roadways.   They are more common in the early part of the monsoon, near agricultural areas, and near Willcox Playa in Cochise County. Use caution in these areas any time thunderstorms are nearby.   Familiarize yourself with these terms to help identify a dust storm hazard:  Dust Storm Watch—Tells you when and where dust storms are likely to occur. Watch the sky and stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio, commercial radio or television for information. Dust Storm Warning—Issued when visibility is 1/2 mile or less due to blowing dust or sand, and wind speeds of 30 miles an hour or more. Close DURING PULL OFF! LIGHTS OFF! FOOT OFF! If you encounter a dust storm while driving, pull off the road immediately. Turn off your headlights and taillights, put your vehicle in "PARK," and take your foot off the brake (so your brake lights are not illuminated.) Other motorists may tend to follow taillights in an attempt to get through the dust storm, and may strike your vehicle from behind.  Stay in the vehicle with your seatbelts buckled and wait for the storm to pass.  Dust storms usually last a few minutes and up to an hour at most. Stay where you are until the dust storm passes. Avoid driving into or through a dust storm. If you encounter a dust storm: Immediately check traffic around your vehicle (front, back and to the side) and begin slowing down. Do not wait until poor visibility makes it difficult to safely pull off the roadway -- do it as soon as possible. Completely exit the highway if you can. Do not stop in a travel lane or in the emergency lane. Look for a safe place to pull completely off the paved portion of the roadway. Drivers of high-profile vehicles should be especially aware of changing weather conditions and travel at reduced speeds. Close   AFTER  Follow instructions from the National Weather Service about additional hazardous conditions that may be expected.
City of Chandler, AZ	https://www.chandleraz.gov/chandler-a-z/thunderstorms-haboobs-and-lightning	Arizona	NA	English	Dust Storm Warning, Wind Advisory	Monsoons, Thunderstorms, Haboobs and Lightning Thunderstorms, especially strong storms generated during the annual summer monsoon season, contain several potential dangers to residents of Arizona. In the event that the City of Chandler and surrounding areas experience severe thunderstorms, everyone in the community should be aware of and prepared for the dangers presented by heavy rains, hail, flash flooding, lightning, strong winds and dust storms.       Wall of Dust Over Chandler Blowing Dust Any moderate to severe wind in the arid Sonoran Desert can generate blowing dust that can impair visibility for drivers on Arizona roads and highways.   During the hot summer months, shifting wind patterns can bring enough moisture into the region to cause strong thunderstorms to develop over the mountains and surrounding deserts. These storm systems can produce strong outflow winds that pick up and drive dust ahead of the storm, sometimes forming "walls" of thick dust that rise several thousand feet above the desert floor. Some locals refer to these larger dust storms as haboobs, and while they are visually stunning, they can also be dangerous due to their strong winds and the resulting reduction in visibility.  Everyone who drives in Arizona should know the actions they can take to stay safe if they encounter blowing dust.  Pull Aside, Stay Alive One of the best resources for learning what to do if you encounter a dust storm is the Arizona Department of Public Safety (ADOT) website, pullasidestayalive.org. All drivers need to know that the most important thing they can do is to not drive into a dust storm. Visibility can very quickly drop to zero, putting everyone in a dangerous situation. If you do encounter a dust storm and you don’t have time to exit the highway, remember these tips (at right):  Immediately check traffic around your vehicle (front, back and to the side) and begin slowing down. Do not wait until poor visibility makes it difficult to safely pull off the roadway – do it as soon as possible. Completely exit the highway if you can. Do not stop in a travel lane or in the emergency lane. Look for a safe place to pull completely off the paved portion of the roadway.   Turn off all vehicle lights, including your emergency flashers. You do not want other vehicles approaching from behind to use your lights as a guide, possibly crashing into your parked vehicle. Set your emergency brake and take your foot off the brake. Stay in the vehicle with your seatbelts buckled and wait for the storm to pass. Drivers of high-profile vehicles should be especially aware of changing weather conditions and travel at reduced speeds. What To Do When a Storm Approaches If Indoors Secure outdoor objects such as lawn furniture that could blow away or cause damage or injury. Shutter windows securely and brace outside doors. For power outages, listen to a battery-operated radio or television for the latest storm information. If you have access to cable, Channel 11 may post warnings and other storm-related information as well. Telephone lines and metal pipes can conduct electricity. Unplug appliances not necessary for obtaining weather information. Avoid using the telephone or any electrical appliances. Use phones only in an emergency. Do not take a bath or shower during the storm. Do not go swimming during a storm. Turn off air conditioners. Power surges from lightning can overload the compressors. If Outdoors Find shelter in a building or car. Do not take shelter in small sheds or under isolated trees. If you are unable to find shelter, go to a low-lying, open place away from trees, poles, or metal objects and crouch with hands on knees. Do not lie flat on the ground. Stay out of pools and away from water. Get to higher ground if flash flooding or flooding is possible. Once flooding begins, abandon cars and climb to higher ground. Do not attempt to drive to safety. Note: Most flash flood deaths occur in automobiles. SRP Storm Safety Tips  Lightning over Chandler Fire Department headquarters Lightning Do not shower during a storm. Lightning can travel through pipes. Do not swim during a storm. Lightning can strike bodies of water. Lightning can travel through electric lines and damage electronic equipment. Therefore, when practical, unplug the power cords to all electronic equipment to provide total protection from lightning-induced damage. Safety Tips from SRP:  Stay at least 100 feet from any downed power line. Never try to help someone trapped by a power line. The line could be energized and endanger your own safety. Instead, immediately call 911 for help. Then call SRP's emergency number, 602-236-8811, to report the incident. If a power line hits your car while you are in it, stay inside the car until professional help arrives. If your vehicle catches fire and you must leave it, avoid making contact with the vehicle and the ground at the same time. Jump from the vehicle, landing with both feet together. Shuffle or hop away, keeping both feet in contact with each other until you are at least 100 feet from the vehicle. This may avoid making your body a ground path between energized and grounded areas or objects.

The crash in Montgomery County saw more than 70 commercial and passenger vehicles involved in collisions along a two-mile stretch of Interstate 55 Monday morning, 75 miles north of St. Louis.  According to the Associated Press, dust from nearby farm fields had been kicked up by a windstorm culminating in the collisions. The six who died had all been in the northbound lanes, while 37 people, ranging in age from 2 to 80, on each side of I-55 were taken to hospitals in various conditions.  Here is how Arizona drivers can stay safe during the upcoming monsoon season.  Arizona braces for upcoming monsoon season Every summer, looming walls of dust swamp the Phoenix area during the Valley's monsoon season, often spanning more than 50 miles and reaching 5,000 feet. A dust storm can have hazardous effects such as poor air quality, dust pollution, low visibility and overall damage.  The consequences of harmful dust pollution include asthma flare-ups, lung cancer, heart attack and even premature death — more than a thousand deaths in a year, according to recent statistics, and the number is possibly rising each year.  The air Arizonans breathe turns deadly when summer dust storms roll through   Based on projections from climate models, the Southwest is going to experience increasingly dry conditions and higher levels of outdoor dust, climate scientist Ploy Pattanun Achakulwisut told The Republic in 2019. It’s going to take more than just peer-reviewed studies to respond to climate-driven threats, Achakulwisut said.  How do I know if a dust storm is on its way? A good way to stay up to date on upcoming weather patterns is to check in with your local National Weather Service.   Any of the three Arizona-based National Weather Service Twitter accounts — Phoenix, Flagstaff, Tucson — provide insightful and timely updates on where and when a storm could be headed.   The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality's Air Quality Snapshots give accessible and accurate readings of the Air Quality Index (AQI) and Air Quality Risk-Based (AQR) for different cities and towns across Arizona.  How do I protect my house during a dust storm? Protecting your home during a dust storm is similar to protecting your home from a large wind event. Maricopa County Emergency Management recommends these tips:  Secure outdoor items (furniture and loose gutters) Shutter/close windows and secure outside doors Trim tree branches away from your house Consider turning off air-conditioning/heating system until the dust storm passes Bring pets indoors 41 years later, officials identify body found near Kingman Phoenix asks federal judge to amend 'Zone' restrictions Gov. Hobbs backs making this October holiday official Israel is at war with Hamas. What Arizonans need to know How do I drive in a dust storm? The Arizona Department of Transportation has developed a list of useful tips for motorists who may get stuck in a dust storm as they are driving. The "Pull Aside, Stay Alive" campaign seeks to save drivers from dangerous situations by providing tips to survive a blowing dust event.    If you encounter a dust storm, immediately check traffic around your vehicle (front, back and to the side) and begin slowing down. Do not wait until poor visibility makes it difficult to safely pull off the roadway — do it as soon as possible. Completely exit the highway if you can. Do not stop in a travel lane or in the emergency lane. Look for a safe place to pull completely off the paved portion of the roadway. Turn off all vehicle lights. You do not want other vehicles approaching from behind to use your lights as a guide and possibly crash into your parked vehicle. Set your emergency brake and take your foot off the brake. Stay in the vehicle with your seat belt buckled and wait for the storm to pass. Drivers of high-profile vehicles should be especially aware of changing weather conditions and travel at reduced speeds.  More information on dust storm safety can be found at PullAsideStayAlive.org, and safety tips for driving in rainstorms can be found at azdot.gov/monsoon.

Arizona Department of Transportation	https://azdot.gov/news/monsoons-arrival-reminder-pull-aside-stay-alive	Arizona	6/15/2023	English	Dust Storm Warning, Wind Advisory	Monsoon’s arrival a reminder to Pull Aside, Stay Alive June 15, 2023 ADOT urges drivers to be ready for dust storms, rain as monsoon season begins PHOENIX – It can seemingly happen in an instant: A wall of dust blows across a highway and blinds drivers. Heavy rain then covers the roadway in water. It’s nearly impossible to drive – and surely unsafe.  In a panic, overwhelmed drivers may be unpared to safely navigate the powerful forces of a monsoon storm.  The solution is simple: Pull Aside, Stay Alive.  With Thursday, June 15, marking the official start of the monsoon season, the Arizona Department of Transportation has simple tips to help drivers stay safe when summer storms pack dust and heavy rain.  The surest defense when dust storms are brewing is to not drive into one. Yet because storms can form and move quickly, motorists need to know how to act quickly if they find themselves in the thick of a blinding dust. ADOT’s Pull Aside, Stay Alive safety campaign offers these additional tips:  If in a dust storm, check for traffic around your vehicle and begin slowing down. Pull off the roadway as soon as possible – completely, if you can – without waiting for visibility to worsen. Turn off your engine. Turn off all vehicle lights. Vehicles approaching from behind could use your headlights as a guide and potentially crash into you. Take your foot off the brake and set the emergency brake. Stay in your vehicle and remain buckled up until the storm passes. Those who travel Interstate 10 between Phoenix and Tucson should also be aware of ADOT’s dust detection and warning system. Active along a 10-mile corridor between Eloy and Picacho Peak, this automated system can lower the speed limit from the normal 75 mph to as low as 35 mph depending on visibility. The reduced speed limits are enforceable.  The clearly marked corridor includes overhead message boards that feature safety warnings when the system is activated. While the system was designed to help drivers move through the area more safely during dust storms, it does not replace common sense. As is the case anywhere in Arizona where dust storms pop up, drivers should be prepared to pull over even with the additional safety features in the area.   ADOT routinely services the equipment in the corridor for reliability, just as the agency works year-round to maintain more than 55 pump stations along Phoenix-area freeways. Those stations can include up to four pumps driven by powerful engines capable of lifting more than 12,000 gallons of stormwater per minute.  Still, localized storms that drop more than 2 inches of rain per hour can tax any drainage system, and ADOT focuses on having technicians ready to respond if issues occur with any pump stations. If freeway flooding does occur in a low-lying area, avoid driving into the water and wait for emergency responders to provide assistance.   Motorists should also be prepared to slow down any time rain has fallen on freeways or local roadways. Allow extra room between vehicles to provide a safe stopping distance.  More information on dust storm safety is available at PullAsideStayAlive.org, and safety tips for driving in rain storms are posted at azdot.gov/monsoon.

Arizona Department of Health Services	https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/extreme-weather/index.php#cold-safety-tips	Arizona	N/A	English	Extreme Cold Warning	Extreme Cold - Safety Tips Give space heaters space. Keep fixed and portable space heaters at least three feet from anything that can burn. Turn off heaters when you leave the room or go to sleep. Do not use stoves and ovens to heat your residence. Check smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors - Make sure alarms and CO detectors are working properly, and replace batteries as necessary. Increased usage of fireplaces during the winter can lead to more pollutants in the air, resulting in increased occurrence of respiratory and lung diseases. A 'No Burn Day' may be issued when pollutant levels are high and can harm people's health. Take note that on a 'No Burn Day,' all wood burning activities in fireplaces, wood stoves and fire pits are banned. You can check ADEQ's Daily Air Quality Forecast electronically or by telephone at (602) 771-2367. During a 'No Burn Day,' you may use natural gas fireplaces, or call (602) 506-6010 with any wood-burning questions. On these days, do not burn wood in an indoor fireplace, wood stove, outdoor chiminea, or fire pit. Do not burn manufactured/wax logs. On days when it is safe to burn, set your thermostat to 65°F or lower before igniting your fireplace, use only EPA-approved residential wood burning devices, and use only wood kindling when starting a fire, then use larger pieces of wood for sustained burning. Always burn the driest wood first. Wet wood causes more smoke. Stay safe while driving by preparing your car for winter weather, especially if you live in an area where it may snow. Never drive into snowy or cold conditions without a fully-charged cell phone, drinking water, winter coats, warm blankets or both. Maintain at least a half tank of gas in your vehicle during the winter season and keep an emergency supply kit in your car. Notify someone of your route, destination, and projected arrival time. When driving in winter weather, exercise caution and use slower speeds. Plan out your route in advance and avoid using cruise control.
Red Cross	https://www.redcross.org/about-us/news-and-events/news/2019/how-to-stay-safe-if-a-wildfire-threatens.html	National	7/25/2019	English	Fire Warning	Thursday, July 25, 2019 — The warm weather brings higher temperatures and dry winds which increase the threat of wildfires at this time of year. With millions of homes near woodlands, the  American Red Cross offers tips on what to do if a wildfire threatens so you can better protect yourself and your loved ones.  WILDFIRE SAFETY STEPS  A wildfire can spread very quickly, giving you little time to evacuate to safety. Be prepared to evacuate at a moment’s notice. Obey evacuation orders from officials.  Back your car into the garage or park it outside in the direction of your evacuation route. Confine pets to one room so you can find them if you need to evacuate quickly. Limit exposure to smoke and dust - keep indoor air clean by closing windows and doors to prevent outside smoke from getting in. Do not use anything that burns and adds to indoor pollution such as candles, fire places and gas stoves.    If you are trapped outdoors, crouch in a pond, river or pool.  Do not put wet clothing or bandanas over your mouth or nose. Moist air causes more damage to airways than dry air at the same temperature. If there is no body of water, look for shelter in a cleared area or among a bed of rocks. Lie flat, face down, and cover your body with soil. Breathe the air close to the ground to avoid scorching your lungs or inhaling smoke.    Do not return home until officials say it is safe to do so.  Inspect the roof immediately and extinguish any sparks or embers. Wildfires may have left embers that could reignite. For several hours afterward, recheck for smoke and sparks throughout the home, including the attic. Keep checking your home for embers that could cause fires.    DOWNLOAD RED CROSS APPS The Red Cross app “Emergency” can help keep you and your loved ones safe by putting vital information in your hand for more than 35 customizable severe weather and emergency alerts.

Red Cross	https://www.redcross.org/about-us/news-and-events/news/2020/safety-steps-wildfires-power-outages-plague-western-states.html	National	NA	English	Fire Warning	Safety Steps: Wildfires, Power Outages Plague Western States  Extreme heat, strong winds and dry conditions are leading to critical wildfire conditions in the West, as well as power outages in some areas. The American Red Cross has steps people can take to remain safe.  While conditions around some of the fires have improved, a new wildfire, the Creek Fire in Madera, Mariposa and Fresno counties, prompted new evacuation orders over the weekend. Combined with high temperatures and the Santa Ana winds, the western part of the country is facing extreme or critical fire conditions.  People are also living with power outages during unusually high temperatures. In California, Washington and Oregon, more than 289,000 homes and businesses have no power.  Follow these steps to be ready and to help you stay safe:  WILDFIRE SAFETY STEPS  A wildfire can spread very quickly, leaving you little time to get to safety. Be prepared to evacuate at a moment’s notice and obey all evacuation orders from officials.  Back your car into the garage or park it outside, facing the direction of your evacuation route. Confine pets to one room, so you can find them if you need to evacuate quickly. Limit exposure to smoke and dust. Keep indoor air clean by closing windows and doors to prevent outside smoke from getting in. Don’t use anything that burns, such as candles, fireplaces and gas stoves.   If you’re trapped outdoors, crouch in a pond, river or pool.  Don’t put wet clothing or bandanas over your mouth or nose, as moist air can cause more damage to your airway than dry air at the same temperature. If there is no body of water, look for shelter in a cleared area or among a bed of rocks. Lie flat, face down, and cover your body with soil. Breathe the air close to the ground to avoid scorching your lungs or inhaling smoke.   Don’t return home until officials say it’s safe to do so.  Inspect the roof immediately and extinguish any sparks or embers. Wildfires may have left embers that could reignite. Check your home for embers that could cause fires. Look for signs of a fire including smoke or sparks. Avoid damaged or downed power lines, poles and wires. Keep your animals under your direct control. Hidden embers and hot spots could burn them. Wet down debris to minimize breathing in dust particles. Wear leather gloves and shoes with heavy soles. Throw out any food that has been exposed to heat, smoke or soot.   WHAT TO DO IF THE POWER IS OUT  Power outages can be frustrating and troublesome. For prolonged power outages, there are ways that you can minimize loss and keep everyone as comfortable as possible.  Use flashlights in the dark — not candles. Eliminate unnecessary travel, especially by car. Traffic lights will be out and roads will be congested. Turn off and unplug all unnecessary electrical equipment. Turn off or disconnect any appliances — such as stoves — equipment and electronics that you were using when the power went out. When power comes back on, surges or spikes can damage equipment. Leave one light on, so you’ll know when power is restored.   If a power outage is two hours or less, don’t be concerned about losing perishable foods. During a prolonged outage, keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to protect your food.  First, use perishable food from the refrigerator. Perishables are safe to eat when they have a temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below. Then, use food from the freezer. If the power outage will continue beyond a day, prepare a cooler with ice for your freezer items. Keep food in a dry, cool spot and cover it at all times.   If you are using a generator, keep it dry and don’t use it in wet conditions.  Never use a generator, grill, camp stove or other gasoline, propane, natural gas or charcoal-burning devices inside a home, garage, basement, crawlspace or any partially enclosed area. Keep these devices outside away from doors, windows and vents, which could allow carbon monoxide to come indoors. Operate the generator on a dry surface under an open canopy-like structure, such as under a tarp held up by poles. Don’t touch a generator with wet hands. Turn the generator off and let it cool down before refueling. Gasoline spilled on hot engine parts could ignite. Plug appliances directly into the generator. Never try to power the house wiring by plugging the generator into a wall outlet.   Download the free Red Cross Emergency App to have power outage safety information right at your fingertips. The Emergency App provides real-time weather alerts and tips on how to stay safe during power outages and countless other emergencies.

These dangerous fires spread quickly and can devastate not only wildlife and natural areas, but also communities.  Prepare for Wildfires feature_mini img Recognize Warnings and Alerts  Have several ways to receive alerts. Download the FEMA app and receive real-time alerts from the National Weather Service for up to five locations nationwide. Sign up for community alerts in your area and be aware of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA), which requires no-sign up. Pay attention to air quality alerts. feature_mini img Make an Emergency Plan  Make sure everyone in your household knows and understands what to do if you need to quickly evacuate.   Don’t forget a plan for the office, kids’ daycare and anywhere you frequent.  feature_mini img Review Important Documents  Make sure your insurance policies and personal documents, like ID, are up to date. Make copies and keep them in a secure password-protected digital space. feature_mini img Strengthen your Home  Use fire-resistant materials to build, renovate or make repairs. Find an outdoor water source with a hose that can reach any area of your property. Create a fire-resistant zone that is free of leaves, debris or flammable materials for at least 30 feet from your home. Designate a room that can be closed off from outside air. Close all doors and windows. Set up a portable air cleaner to keep indoor pollution levels low when smoky conditions exist. feature_mini img Know your Evacuation Zone  Image Illustration of a couple looking at an evacuation map.  You may have to evacuate quickly due to a wildfire. Learn your evacuation routes, practice with household, pets and identify where you will go. Follow the instructions from local authorities. They will provide the latest recommendations based on the threat to your community and appropriate safety measures. feature_mini img Gather Supplies  Have enough supplies for your household, including a first aid kit, in your go bag or car trunk. Being prepared allows you to avoid unnecessary excursions and to address minor medical issues at home, alleviating the burden on urgent care centers and hospitals. Remember that not everyone can afford to respond by stocking up on necessities. For those who can afford it, making essential purchases and slowly building up supplies in advance will allow for longer time periods between shopping trips. Be cautious when carrying flammable or combustible household products that can cause fires or explosions if handled wrong, such as aerosols, cooking oils, rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer. If available, store an N95 mask to protect yourself from smoke inhalation. Keep your cell phone charged when wildfires could be in your area. Purchase backup charging devices to power electronics. Stay Safe During Pay attention to emergency alerts and notifications for information and instructions. Evacuate immediately if authorities tell you to do so! Check with local authorities for the latest information about public shelters or check open locations on the FEMA app. You can also download the free Red Cross Emergency app for a list of open Red Cross shelters in your area. Consider making plans with friends or family to shelter with them where you may be safer and more comfortable. If trapped, call 9-1-1 and give your location, but be aware that emergency response could be delayed or impossible. Turn on lights to help rescuers find you. Use an N95 mask to protect yourself from smoke inhalation or limit your exposure to smoke by doing the following: Choose a room to close off from outside air and set up a portable air cleaner or filter to keep the air in this room clean even when it’s smoky in the rest of the building and outdoors. Use high efficiency filters in your central air conditioning system to capture fine particles from smoke. If your system has fresh air intake, set the system to “recirculate” mode and close the outdoor intake damper. If you are not ordered to evacuate but smoky conditions exist, stay inside in a safe location or go to a community building where smoke levels are lower. If you are sick and need medical attention, contact your healthcare provider for further care instructions and shelter in place, if possible. Returning Home After a Wildfire Do not return home until authorities say it is safe to do so. Avoid hot ash, charred trees, smoldering debris and live embers. The ground may contain heat pockets that can burn you or spark another fire. When cleaning, wear protective clothing – including a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, work gloves and sturdy thick-soled shoes – during clean-up efforts. Use a respirator to limit your exposure, and wet debris to minimize breathing dust particles. People with asthma, COPD and/or other lung conditions should take precautions in areas with poor air quality, as it can worsen symptoms. Document property damage with photographs. Conduct an inventory and contact your insurance company for assistance. Send text messages or use social media to reach out to family and friends. Phone systems are often busy following a disaster. Make calls only in emergencies.

Si no se ordena que usted desaloje, pero hay mucho humo en el aire, quédese adentro en un lugar seguro o vaya a un edificio de la comunidad donde haya niveles más bajos de humo. Si usted está enfermo y necesita atención médica, comuníquese con su proveedor médico para obtener instrucciones adicionales y refúgiese en el lugar, de ser posible. Volver a su hogar después de un incendio forestal No vuelva a su hogar hasta que las autoridades hayan dicho que es seguro hacerlo. Manténgase alejado de cenizas calientes, árboles carbonizados, escombros ardientes y brasas encendidas. El suelo podrá contener cavidades calientes que podrían ocasionar quemaduras o causar otro incendio. Cuando esté limpiando, debe vestirse con ropa protectora – incluyendo camisas de manga larga, pantalón largo, guantes de trabajo, y calzado resistente con suela gruesa – durante las labores de limpieza. Utilice una mascarilla para limitar su exposición, y moje los escombros para minimizar la inhalación de partículas de polvo. Las personas con asma, enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva crónica u otras afecciones pulmonares deben tomar precauciones en áreas con una calidad deficiente del aire, ya que podría empeorar sus síntomas. Tome fotografías para documentar los daños a la propiedad. Realice un inventario y comuníquese con su compañía de seguros para asistencia. Envíe mensajes de texto o use las redes sociales para comunicarse con su familia y amigos. Los sistemas telefónicos suelen estar ocupados después de un desastre.

Resources IBHS/NFPA Wildfire Research Fact sheets on roofs decks, attics and crawl spaces and fencing Before a wildfire threatens your area… In and around your home  Clear leaves and other debris from gutters, eaves, porches and decks. This prevents embers from igniting your home. Remove dead vegetation and other items from under your deck or porch, and within 10 feet of the house. Learn more about the basics of defensible space on the Firewise website. Screen or box-in areas below patios and decks with wire mesh to prevent debris and combustible materials from accumulating. Remove flammable materials (firewood stacks, propane tanks) within 30 feet of your home’s foundation and outbuildings, including garages and sheds. If it can catch fire, don’t let it touch your house, deck or porch. Wildfire can spread to tree tops. Prune trees so the lowest branches are 6 to 10 feet from the ground. Keep your lawn hydrated and maintained. If it is brown, cut it down to reduce fire intensity. Dry grass and shrubs are fuel for wildfire. Don’t let debris and lawn cuttings linger. Dispose of these items quickly to reduce fuel for fire. Inspect shingles or roof tiles. Replace or repair those that are loose or missing to prevent ember penetration. Cover exterior attic vents with metal wire mesh no larger than 1/8 inch to prevent sparks from entering the home. Enclose under-eave and soffit vents or screens with metal mesh to prevent ember entry. Learn more about how to protect your home and property at www.firewise.org. Creating an emergency plan  Assemble an emergency supply kit and place it in a safe spot. Remember to include important documents, medications and personal identification. Develop an emergency evacuation plan and practice it with everyone in your home. Plan two ways out of your neighborhood and designate a meeting place. Learn more about emergency preparedness planning on NFPA’s emergency planning webpage. In your community:  Contact your local planning/zoning office to find out if your home is in a high wildfire risk area, and if there are specific local or county ordinances you should be following. If you are part of a homeowner association, work with them to identify regulations that incorporate proven preparedness landscaping, home design and building material use. Talk to your local fire department about how to prepare, when to evacuate, and the response you and your neighbors can expect in the event of a wildfire. Learn about wildfire risk reduction efforts, including how land management agencies use prescribed fire to manage local landscapes. Learn how you can make a positive difference in your community.

During the time a wildfire is in your area… Stay aware of the latest news and updates from your local media and fire department. Get your family, home and pets prepared to evacuate. Place your emergency supply kit and other valuables in your vehicle. Move patio or deck furniture, cushions, door mats and potted plants in wooden containers either indoors or as far away from the home, shed and garage as possible. Close and protect your home’s openings, including attic and basement doors and vents, windows, garage doors and pet doors to prevent embers from penetrating your home. Connect garden hoses and fill any pools, hot tubs, garbage cans, tubs, or other large containers with water. Firefighters have been known to use the hoses to put out fires on rooftops. Leave as early as possible, before you’re told to evacuate. Do not linger once evacuation orders have been given. Promptly leaving your home and neighborhood clears roads for firefighters to get equipment in place to fight the fire, and helps ensure residents’ safety. After a wildfire has been contained… Continue to listen to news updates for information about the fire. Return home only when authorities say it is safe. Visit FEMA/Ready.gov for more information regarding wildfire after an emergency.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/wildfires/duringfire.html	National	6/12/2023	English	Fire Warning	Stay Safe During a Wildfire Stay safe during a fire. Pay attention to local weather forecasts, especially those that may affect fire conditions, and always follow instructions given by local emergency management officials.  Protect yourself from smoke. When wildfires create smoky conditions it’s important for everyone to reduce their exposure to smoke. Wildfire smoke irritates your eyes, nose, throat, and lungs. It can make it hard to breathe and make you cough or wheeze. Children and people with asthma, COPD, heart disease, or who are pregnant need to be especially careful about breathing wildfire smoke.   Keep smoke outside.  Choose a room you can close off from outside air. Set up a portable air cleaner or a filter to keep the air in this room clean even when it’s smoky in the rest of the building and outdoors. If you use a do-it-yourself box fan filtration unit, never leave it unattended. Reduce your smoke exposure by wearing a respirator [PDF – 329 KB].  A respirator is a mask that fits tightly to your face to filter out smoke before you breathe it in. You must wear the right respirator and wear it correctly [PDF – 2.7 MB]. Children ages 2 years and older can wear respirators and masks. However, NIOSH Approved respirators do not come in suitable sizes for very young children. If you have heart or lung disease ask your doctor if it is safe for you to wear a respirator. Avoid using candles, gas, propane, wood-burning stoves, fireplaces, or aerosol sprays and don’t fry or broil meat, smoke tobacco products, or vacuum. If you have a central air conditioning system, use high efficiency filters to capture fine particles from smoke. If your system has a fresh air intake, set the system to recirculate mode or close the outdoor intake damper. Pets and other animals can be affected by wildfire smoke too.  Learn how to protect pets and livestock. Some evacuation centers do not accept animals. Check Petfinder’s Shelter Center or RedRover for information on local animal shelters and rescue groups Keep track of fires near you so you can be ready.

National Weather Service	https://www.weather.gov/safety/wildfire	National	NA	English	Fire Warning	Wildfire Weather Safety  NOAA's National Weather Service works in conjunction with federal and state wildland managers to protect lives and property in and around America's wildlands. This site will help you prepare, be aware and act early if a wildfire comes your way. A list of partners can be found on the National Interagency Fire Center website. If you, or someone you know, have been a victim of a wildfire, please share your story so we can prevent others from becoming a victim. When you write, please note that NWS has permission to use your story and, if possible, let us know the town and state you were in and the year the event took place.  Understanding Wildfire Warnings, Watches and Behavior  Wildfire Resources Red Flag Warning: Take Action. Be extremely careful with open flames. NWS issues a Red Flag Warning, in conjunction with land management agencies, to alert land managers to an ongoing or imminent critical fire weather pattern. NWS issues a Red Flag Warning when fire conditions are ongoing or expected to occur shortly. Fire Weather Watch: Be Prepared. A Watch alerts land managers and the public that upcoming weather conditions could result in extensive wildland fire occurrence or extreme fire behavior. A watch means critical fire weather conditions are possible but not imminent or occurring. Extreme Fire Behavior: This alert implies a wildfire likely to rage of out of control. If is often hard to predict these fires because such they behave erratically, sometimes dangerously.One or more of the following criteria must be met: Moving fast: High rate of spread Prolific crowning and/or spotting Presence of fire whirls Strong convection column  Preparedness  Wildfire Resources Take personal responsibility and prepare long before the threat of a wildland fire so your home is ready in case of a fire:  Create defensible space by clearing brush away from your home. Use fire-resistant landscaping and harden your home with fire-safe construction measures. Put together a basic emergency supply kit. Check emergency equipment, such as flashlights and generators. Plan escape routes and make sure all those residing within the home know the plan of action. Learn more ways to protect yourself, your family and your property Before an emergency happens, sit down with your family or close friends and decide how you will get in contact with each other, where you will go, and what you will do in an emergency. Keep a copy of this plan in your emergency supplies kit or another safe place where you can access it in the event of a disaster. Start at the Ready.Gov emergency plan webpage. Review your insurance policies to ensure that you have adequate coverage for your home and personal property. Understand NWS forecast products, especially the meaning of NWS watches and warnings.  Set—Situational Awareness  Wildfire Resources Pack your emergency items.  Stay aware of the latest wildfire news at the National Interagency Fire Center Large Fire News site or Incident Information Site (Inciweb) and information on your local National Weather Service office and local government/emergency management office. Find out what type of emergencies could occur and how you should respond. Listen to NOAA Weather Radio or other radio or TV stations for the latest storm news. Follow instructions issued by local officials. Leave immediately if ordered! If NOT ordered to evacuate: Do not light campfires, bonfires, candles or anything else that could blow over and start a fire. If you smoke, be sure to extinguish your cigarette or cigar before disposing of it. Never throw a burning item out a window. Bag up trash, clippings and other easily flammable items. Fill up your vehicle in case you need to evacuate.  Go—Act Early!  Wildfire Resources Follow your personal wildland fire action plan. Following your plan will not only support your safety, but will allow firefighters to best maneuver resources to combat  the fire. Continue listening to a NOAA Weather Radio or the local news for the latest updates. If you were told to evacuate, return home only when officials say it is safe. Once home, drive only if necessary. If you must go out, watch for fallen objects in the road, downed electrical wires, and weakened walls, bridges, roads, and sidewalks that might collapse. Walk carefully around the outside of your home to check for damaged power lines, gas leaks, and structural damage. Stay out of any building in which you smell gas, see smoke or flames or if the building or home was damaged by fire, or if the authorities have not declared it safe. Carbon monoxide poisoning is one of the leading causes of death after storms in areas dealing with power outages. Never use a portable generator inside your home or garage. Review generator safety. Use battery-powered flashlights. Do NOT use candles. Turn on your flashlight before entering a vacated building. The battery could produce a spark that could ignite leaking gas, if present.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/floods/readiness.html	National	10/9/2018	English	Flood Warning	Preparing for a Flood  Keep yourself and your loved ones safe by planning ahead.  Are you in a flash-flood prone area? Contact the local county geologist or county planning department to find out if your home is located in a flash-flood-prone area or landslide-prone area. Make a communication plan and a disaster plan for your family. Plan and practice a flood evacuation route with your family. Ask an out-of-state relative or friend to be the “family contact” in case your family is separated during a flood. Make sure everyone in your family knows the name, address, and phone number of this contact person. Stay informed. Learn about your community’s emergency plans, warning signals, evacuation routes, and locations of emergency shelters. Inform local authorities about any special needs, i.e., elderly or bedridden people, or anyone with a disability. Get your home ready for a flood. Make sure you secure or protect any hazards in your home before the flood strikes. Be prepared to turn off electrical power when there is standing water, fallen power lines, or before you evacuate. Turn off gas and water supplies before you evacuate. Secure structurally unstable building materials. Buy a fire extinguisher if you don’t already have one. Make sure your family knows where it is and how to use it. Buy and install sump pumps with back-up power. Have a licensed electrician raise electric components (switches, sockets, circuit breakers and wiring) at least 12″ above your home’s projected flood elevation. For drains, toilets, and other sewer connections, install backflow valves or plugs to prevent floodwaters from entering. Anchor fuel tanks which can contaminate your basement if torn free. An unanchored tank outside can be swept downstream and damage other houses. If you are under a flood watch or warning: Gather the emergency supplies you previously stocked in your home and stay tuned to local radio or television station for updates. Turn off all utilities at the main power switch and close the main gas valve if evacuation appears necessary. Have your immunization records handy or be aware of your last tetanus shot, in case you should receive a puncture wound or a wound becomes contaminated during or after the flood. Prepare an emergency water supply. Store at least 1 gallon of water per day for each person and each pet. Store at least a 3-day supply. Bring outdoor possessions, such as lawn furniture, grills and trash cans inside or tie them down securely. Create an emergency supply kit. Stock your home with supplies you may need during the flood by creating an emergency supply kit. Visit CDC’s Personal Health Preparedness page for a list of supplies you’ll want to include in your kit. Be sure to also include the following supplies in your kit:  An emergency kit for your car with food, flares, booster cables, maps, tools, a first aid kit, fire extinguisher, sleeping bags, etc. Rubber boots, sturdy shoes, and waterproof gloves. Insect repellent containing DEET or Picaridin, screens, or long-sleeved and long-legged clothing for protection from mosquitoes which may gather in pooled water remaining after the flood. (More information about these and other recommended repellents can be found in the fact sheet Updated Information Regarding Insect Repellents .) Prepare a food and water supply. Make sure you and your family have enough safe food and water (for drinking, cooking, bathing, etc.) available in the event of a flood. For more information, visit Food and Water Needs: Preparing for a Disaster or Emergency.  Prepare to evacuate. Never ignore an evacuation order— authorities will direct you to leave if you are in a low-lying area or within the greatest potential path of rising waters.  Even if you haven’t been ordered to evacuate yet, it’s always best to be prepared when a flood watch is issued. To prepare your home, car, and loved ones for a potential evacuation:  Fill your vehicle’s gas tank and make sure the emergency kit for your car is ready. If no vehicle is available, make arrangements with friends or family for transportation. Identify essential documents such as medical records, insurance card along with ID cards and put in waterproof material to carry with you during evacuation. Fill your clean water containers. If you have pet, identify a shelter designated for pets. Review your emergency plans and supplies, checking to see if any items are missing. Tune in the radio or television for weather updates. Listen for disaster sirens and warning signals. Put livestock and family pets in a safe area. Due to food and sanitation requirements, emergency shelters cannot accept animals. Adjust the thermostat on refrigerators and freezers to the coolest possible temperature. If you are ordered to evacuate: If a flood warning is issued for your area or you are directed by authorities to evacuate the area:  Take only essential items with you. If you have time, turn off the gas, electricity, and water. Disconnect appliances to prevent electrical shock when power is restored. Follow the designated evacuation routes and expect heavy traffic. Do not attempt to drive or walk across creeks or flooded roads. If you are NOT ordered to evacuate: To get through the storm in the safest possible manner:  Monitor the radio or television for weather updates. Prepare to evacuate to a shelter or to a neighbor’s home if your home is damaged, or if you are instructed to do so by emergency personnel.

Comuníquese con el geólogo de su condado o con el departamento de planeamiento local para averiguar si su casa está en un área propensa a las inundaciones por crecidas torrenciales o los derrumbes. Haga un plan de comunicación y un plan para casos de desastre para su familia. Planifique y practique con su familia una vía de evacuación en caso de inundación. Pídale a un familiar o amigo (que esté fuera del estado en donde usted vive) que sea el “punto de contacto familiar”, en caso de que su familia se separe durante una inundación. Asegúrese de que todos los miembros de su familia sepan el nombre, la dirección y el número telefónico de esta persona de contacto. Manténgase informado. Sepa cuáles son los planes para casos de emergencia de su comunidad, las señales de advertencia, las rutas para la evacuación y dónde están los refugios de emergencia. Informe a las autoridades locales sobre todas las necesidades especiales (es decir, personas de edad avanzada o que deben guardar cama, o si hay alguna persona con una discapacidad). Prepare su casa para una inundación Asegúrese de tomar medidas de seguridad y protección contra todo riesgo que pueda surgir en su casa antes de que llegue la inundación. Esté preparado para cortar la electricidad cuando haya agua estancada o cables del tendido eléctrico caídos, o hágalo antes de la evacuación. Corte el gas y el suministro de agua antes de evacuar el lugar. Sujete bien los materiales de construcción que tengan una estructura inestable. Compre un extintor de incendios si aún no lo tiene. Asegúrese de que su familia sepa dónde encontrarlo y cómo usarlo. Compre e instale bombas de sumidero con energía de reserva. Haga que un electricista profesional cambie la altura de los componentes eléctricos (interruptores, enchufes, disyuntores y cableado) para que estén por lo menos 12 pulgadas por encima del nivel de inundación estimado para su hogar. Para los desagües, inodoros y otras conexiones del alcantarillado, instale válvulas de contraflujo para evitar que el agua de la inundación entre por ellas. Asegure bien los tanques de combustible que puedan contaminar su sótano si llegaran a desprenderse. Un tanque que no esté bien sujeto puede ser arrastrado por la corriente y dañar otras casas. Si está en un área bajo alerta de vigilancia o aviso de inundación: Reúna los suministros de emergencia que haya almacenado en su casa y mantenga sintonizada la estación local de radio o televisión para recibir la información más actualizada. Si parece que será necesario evacuar la zona, apague el interruptor principal de todos los servicios y cierre la válvula principal del gas. Tenga a mano sus registros de vacunación o sepa cuándo recibió la vacuna contra el tétanos por última vez, en caso de que se corte o se le contamine una herida durante o después de la inundación. Prepare un suministro de agua de emergencia. Almacene al menos 1 galón de agua por día para cada persona y cada mascota. Tenga una reserva para al menos 3 días. Lleve adentro de la casa las pertenencias que tenga al aire libre, como muebles del jardín, parrillas y botes de basura, o amárrelos bien a un lugar fijo.

Prepárese para evacuar su casa y dirigirse a un refugio o a la casa de un vecino si su hogar sufrió daños o si se lo indica el personal de emergencia.
National Child Traumatic Stress Network	https://www.nctsn.org/what-is-child-trauma/trauma-types/disasters/flood-resources#tabset-tab-5	National	NA	English	Flood Warning	Description Floods are the most common natural weather event and are temporary conditions when an area is overcome by water or mudflow. Floods occur under many conditions including: hurricanes, tsunamis, overtopped levees, snowmelt, overflowing drainage systems, and heavy rainfall. They most commonly affect those who live or work in low-lying areas, near water, behind a levee or downstream from a dam—areas where water can accumulate, overflow, or be quickly released. Most floods occur over a period of days and in the same region, providing time for formal warnings and preparation. Others, such as flash floods, may occur rapidly and without warning. Before Being prepared beforehand is the best way to help children and families recover after a flood. To improve their preparedness, families should:  Be informed about their flood risk, how to access updated official flood information, and the best evacuation routes. Families should know areas at risk for seasonal or flash flooding and landslide-prone areas; which official websites, radio stations, or social media will provide emergency information; what documents and possessions to bring if needing to evacuate; and whether they have adequate flood insurance. Encourage families to contact local authorities if they have any members who have ongoing health concerns or mobility issues or if they will need assistance during an evacuation. Help families to learn the different flood alerts: Flood Watch: Indicates that an overflow of water from a river is possible for the watch area. Flash Flood Watch: Indicates that flash flooding is possible in or close to the watch area. They may last as long as 12 hours as heavy rains move into and across the area. Flood Warning: Indicates flooding conditions are occurring in the warning area, and those in the warning area should evacuate to higher ground. Flash Flood Warning: Indicates flash flooding is occurring in the warning area, and those in the warning area should evacuate to higher ground. Assemble an emergency go kit. Families should have access to enough water, food, and other emergency supplies for at least 3 days and medications for at least 7 days. Families should also gather important documents, a battery-powered or hand crank radio, and supplies for pets. Keep supplies in a large backpack or easy to carry container in the event the family has to evacuate quickly. Prepare your property. If you live in a flood prone area, keep sandbags and appropriate cleaning supplies available. Also identify potential home hazards and plan to address them if flooding occurs. For example, know how and where to shut off power or gas. Make a family preparedness and communication plan. Since flooding can happen quickly and when families are not together, it is important to have a family communication plan for who to contact during a storm. This includes identifying an out-of-state/area loved one if communications are difficult in the area. Families should have important contact information easily accessible, identify who they can stay with in the event of an evacuation, and plan for sheltering pets and livestock. Families should identify areas around the neighborhood that are elevated and practice these evacuation routes together. Review the family preparedness plan and fill out the preparedness wallet card. Plan for children’s needs. Families should give children factual information about floods in simple terms, including how beneficial some floods can be for the ecosystem. Encourage parents to include children and their babysitters in preparedness activities. Families should also learn about their children’s school or after-school program emergency plans. The mobile app Help Kids Cope provides information on how to talk with children of different developmental levels. During Knowing what to do during a flood can help families feel more in control and take steps to increase their safety. Families should consider the following when responding to a flood.   When not in an evacuation zone, families should: Monitor emergency alerts and stay informed about current weather updates. Check their emergency supplies are updated and prepare for possible evacuation. Families should ensure they have food and water, documents, personal needs, and possessions in one location easily taken if needed. Families should keep cell phones fully charged and know evacuation options. If needing to share a ride, identify potential pick up areas. Be prepared to shut off utilities. Move important items to upper floors or off the ground if there is a concern their home might get flooded. During an evacuation, families should: Gather their emergency go kit, all loved ones, and pets and evacuate. Families should evacuate when ordered and follow official evacuation routes if it is safe to leave by car. They should be discouraged from driving through flooded roads. If needing to share a ride, families should go to the pickup location. If it isn’t safe to evacuate by car, families should evacuate to a neighbors’ home or the nearest high ground. Locate a designated public shelter if needed. Families can text SHELTER and their zip code to 43362 (4FEMA) to find the nearest open shelter. They can also download the American Red Cross Shelter Finder app Leave their property secured. Families should turn off utilities and unplug appliances if time permits. They should implement a plan for pets and livestock if they cannot evacuate with them. Inform other family members when safely out of the flood threat. Immediately after the flooding has stopped or the water has receded, families should: Know about health risks: Immediately after a flood, small children, pregnant women, and people with health problems should avoid the flooded area until the cleanup is complete. Families should keep children away from areas still flooded as floodwaters can contain hazards, bacteria, and chemicals. Be aware of potential hazards. Families should watch for wild animals seeking refuge in homes and downed power lines. They should check for structural damage before re-entering their home and keep the power off until an electrician has inspected the property and deemed it safe. Encourage families to rely on official guidance that it is safe before using water to drink, brush teeth, or bathe. Use protective equipment to clean up flood damage. To prevent mold, families should remove wet contents immediately using rubber gloves, masks, and sturdy soled shoes. Families should monitor any wet items for fungal growth and odor for several days. It is best to discard any food or baby toys soaked by floodwaters. Take steps to recoup losses. Families should make a list of lost or damaged items and take photos of any items that need to be discarded immediately for safety. If their home has been damaged, families should contact their insurance agent to file a claim. Freeze soaked photographs and documents until families have the time and emotional strength to deal with them. Communicate safety with friends and family. Phone systems may not be working, so text messaging and social media may work best. To address children’s reactions during a flood, parents and caregivers can: Model calm behavior. Children may mirror the reactions of adults around them and will learn ideas for how to take care of themselves from what parents and caregivers do. Provide simple but accurate information in a quiet, steady voice. Encourage comforting or distracting activities. Children may benefit from doing slow breathing to calm their bodies, having a stuffed animal or blanket to hold, or being distracted from the storm by dancing, singing, or playing games. Parents and caregivers should not force children to talk about what is happening. Playing outside may not be safe. Here are additional activities for children to do inside. Practice their own self-care. Parents and caregivers may benefit from finding opportunities to take a moment for themselves, express their feelings, acknowledge that it might be a scary or unknown situation, and engage in a coping strategy. Check children for injuries. Parents and caregivers should keep injuries clean and seek medical attention as needed. After After a flood, most families will recover over time. The length of time will depend upon the extent of the flooding, if the evacuation was sudden and frightening, the extent of damage and loss, as well as how well the family copes with post-flood stresses. The amount of support from family, school, and community also helps to reduce the extent of impact. Some families will be able to return to their normal routine quickly, while others will have to contend with significant hardships, financial difficulties, frequent moves, and potentially health issues.  The ways that parents and other caregivers cope during and after the flood influence children’s functioning. Children often turn to adults for information, comfort, and help. Parents and teachers should try to remain calm, answer children’s questions honestly, and respond as best they can to requests. Children and adolescents do better when they understand the event they have just gone through.
Red Cross	https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/flood.html	National	NA	English	Flood Warning	Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods can result from rain, snow, coastal storms, storm surges, overflows of rivers, and dam failure. Floods can be dangerous. People die by drowning when they don’t evacuate before floodwaters come or when they enter floodwaters. Floods can damage buildings and roads, cause power outages, and create landslides.  Floodwaters carry waste and pollute drinking water. Flooding can develop slowly or quickly. Flash floods can be sudden and violent. Climate change increases our risk of many types of flooding. But we can take action to prepare. Prepare now to protect yourself and your loved ones.  What's the Difference Between a Flood Watch and a Flood Warning? Home in flood icon A flood/flash flood WATCH means a flood or flash flood is possible.  Home in flood icon A flood/flash flood WARNING means flooding or flash flooding is already occurring or will occur soon. TAKE IMMEDIATE PRECAUTIONS!  What Should You Do Before a Flood? Understand Your Flood Risk    Learn about the types of flooding that can impact your home and community. Types of flooding include flash floods, river floods, storm surges, coastal floods, burn scars, debris flows, ice/debris jams, snowmelt, dry wash, dam breaks, and levee failures. Reach out to your local office of emergency management for advice. Know your home and community’s flood risk. Visit the FEMA Flood Map Service Center and search for your home using your address. Make Plans to Stay Safe    Flash floods can be sudden and violent. You may have little to no warning. Designate a place on higher ground that you can get to quickly. Plan to move to higher ground before flooding begins. River floods: Know if you are in an area that is prone to river floods. Review your evacuation plan so that you can leave quickly if officials advise you to evacuate. Storm surge: Be prepared to evacuate immediately if local officials advise. A storm surge can cause water levels to rise quickly and flood large areas in just minutes. Coastal flooding: Be prepared to evacuate immediately if local officials advise. Move inland before flooding begins.

A child's toy waits in the mud after a flood How Does the Red Cross Help During a Flood? When a flood occurs, the Red Cross provides shelter, food and comfort.   LEARN ABOUT RED CROSS FLOOD RELIEF How Can You Stay Safe After a Flood? Prevent Injuries    Understand the dangers you may face and keep your loved ones safe. If you evacuated, wait for officials to say it is safe before going home. Avoid fallen power lines, poles, and wires. They can electrocute you. Watch out for falling trees and other debris. Use flashlights or battery-powered lanterns, rather than candles, to reduce fire risk. Many injuries happen during cleanup. Wear protective equipment, like boots, long pants, work gloves, eyewear, and an N95 respirator to protect your lungs. Follow the advice of local public health officials. Learn how to use equipment safely. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water because you could get electrocuted. Cleaning up is a big job. Take care of yourself. Work with a partner and take frequent breaks. Protect Your Health    Flooding can contaminate drinking water. Check with your local public health department about drinking water safety. Don’t get sick from eating spoiled food. Throw out food that got wet or warm. When in doubt, throw it out! Stay away from floodwaters. They may contain sewage, sharp items, and chemicals that can make you ill. If your home was flooded: If possible, dry your home and everything in it as quickly as you can within 24 to 48 hours. If you cannot return to dry your home within 24 to 48 hours, you should assume you have mold growth. When it is safe to return home, completely dry everything, clean up the mold and make sure you don’t still have a moisture problem. Keep wet areas well-ventilated. Throw away wet materials that can’t be repaired or dried. Prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. Gasoline, propane, natural gas, or charcoal-burning devices should never be used inside a home, basement, garage, tent, or camper – or even outside near an open window. Carbon monoxide can’t be seen or smelled, but it can kill you fast. If you start to feel sick, dizzy, or weak, get to fresh air right away – do not delay. Take Care of Yourself    It's normal to have a lot of bad feelings, stress, or anxiety. Eat healthy food and get enough sleep to help you deal with stress.

OSHA	https://www.osha.gov/flood/preparedness	National	NA	English	Flood Warning	Preparedness Planning Having an evacuation plan in place before a flood occurs can help avoid confusion and prevent injuries and property damage. A thorough evacuation plan should include:  Conditions that will activate the plan Chain of command Emergency functions and who will perform them Specific evacuation procedures, including routes and exits Procedures for accounting for personnel, customers and visitors Equipment for personnel Review the plan with workers Warning Systems Flood Watch: Flooding is possible. Monitor radio and television stations for more information.  Flash Flood Watch: Flash flooding is possible. Be prepared to move to higher ground; monitor radio and television stations for more information.  Flood Warning: Imminent threat - Flooding is occurring or will occur soon; if advised to evacuate, do so immediately.  Flash Flood Warning: Imminent threat - A flash flood is occurring or will occur soon; seek higher ground on foot immediately.  See OSHA’s Evacuation Plans and Procedures eTool for more information.  Contact your local county geologist or county planning department to get information about whether your business or residence is in an area that is prone to flooding.  If you are located in an area that is susceptible to flooding, you should monitor NOAA Weather Radio or commercial radio or television stations for information about flood watches and warnings. The box on the left defines the terms commonly used in flood watches and warnings.  If you receive information about the possibility of flash flooding, be prepared to move to higher ground immediately. In all cases, you should be prepared to evacuate before water levels rise and potentially cut off evacuation routes.  Employers whose workers will be involved in emergency response operations for releases of, or substantial threats of releases of, hazardous substances regardless of the location of the hazard must comply with OSHA’s Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standard, 29 CFR 1910.120. This may include emergency response following an earthquake. Instruction CPL 02-02-073 describes OSHA enforcement procedures under the relevant provisions of the HAZWOPER standard.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated a standard applying OSHA’s HAZWOPER standard to state and local government workers in states where there is no OSHA-approved State Plan. See 40 CFR Part 311.  OSHA’s HAZWOPER Safety and Health Topics page explains requirements of the OSHA HAZWOPER standard, including required worker training.

OSHA	https://www.osha.gov/flood/response	National	NA	English	Flood Warning	Response/Recovery In the aftermath of a flood, workers may be involved in a variety of response and recovery operations. The following are general guidelines that may be applicable to workers involved in assessing and/or cleaning up the damage to their worksite. However, some operations, such as utility restoration, cleaning up spills of hazardous materials, and search and rescue, should only be conducted by workers who have the proper training, equipment and experience.  North Dakota Flood    NWS Flood Safety Public Service Announcement: Turn Around Don't Drown. U.S. National Weather Service.  Driving during Flood Conditions It’s important to be careful when driving during flood conditions. Nearly half of flood fatalities are vehicle-related. Six inches of standing water is enough to stall some cars, a foot of water can float a vehicle, and two feet of moving water is enough to sweep a car away. If the water level is rising around your vehicle, you should abandon the vehicle.  Be wary of unknown road conditions. Do not try to cross flooded roadways if you do not know the depth of the water.  Hazards and Precautions The OSHA Resources page has QuickCards™ and Fact Sheets that provide details about hazards present in flooded areas and after a flood has occurred. The information below provides a brief summary of some of the most common hazards associated with floods as well as precautions that can be taken to protect against those hazards:  Electrical hazards Tree and debris removal Carbon monoxide Lifting injuries Mold Rodents, Snakes and Insects Chemical and biological hazards Fire Drowning Hypothermia (due to the cold weather and water exposure) Exhaustion (from working extended shifts) Heat Electrical hazards - QuickCard™ | Español  Where would I expect to find electrical hazards after a flood?  Workers can expect to find standing water present throughout a flood zone. If water has been present anywhere near electrical circuits and electrical equipment, turn off the power at the main breaker or fuse on the service panel. Never enter flooded areas or touch electrical equipment if the ground is wet.  What hazards exist when repairing downed or damaged power lines and what protective measures should be used?  Workers repairing downed electrical lines must be aware of the hazards associated with maintenance on overhead lines, as well as the potential for emergency conditions to create additional hazards. Such work must be performed by utility company workers or other properly trained workers. Potential hazards include:  Electrocution by contact with downed energized lines, or objects in contact with fallen lines. Falls from heights. Being struck or crushed by falling poles, towers and tree limbs. Being injured in vehicular accidents when responding to an emergency situation. Burns from fires caused by energized line contact or equipment failure. Stay well clear of any downed or damaged power lines. Establish a safe distance from the lines and report the incident to the responsible authority. Work on damaged power lines must only be performed by properly trained electrical utility workers. Electrical utility workers must first assess the hazards present in order to minimize the chances of exacerbating the situation. Ideally the lines involved should be de-energized, but this may not be possible in all situations. When working on downed or damaged power lines, electrical workers must utilize proper electrical safety work practices and personal protective equipment.  Debris Pile Tree and debris removal - QuickCard™  What hazards exist during removal of downed trees and debris after a flood, and what safety precautions should be taken?  When floods occur, debris and downed trees can block public roads and damage power lines. As with the electrical hazards, when removing trees and clearing debris there are potential hazards of electrocution from contact with downed power lines or tree limbs in contact with power lines, falls from heights, and being struck or crushed by falling tree limbs. Another potential hazard of tree and debris removal is being injured by the equipment, such as chain saws and chippers (see OSHA's QuickCards™ on Chain Saw Safety and Chipper Machine Safety).  Proper protective equipment, including gloves, chaps, foot protection, eye protection, fall protection, hearing protection and head protection, must be used when using chainsaws and chippers to clear downed trees.  Only appropriate power equipment that is built to be used outdoors and in wet conditions should be used. All saws, chippers, and other tools should be used properly and according to their intended application. All equipment should be well-maintained and functioning correctly. In addition, all equipment should have proper guarding, working controls, and other safety features as installed by the manufacturer.  Carbon monoxide - QuickCard™ | Español  Gasoline and diesel powered generators, pumps, and pressure washers all release carbon monoxide, a deadly, colorless, odorless gas. These devices must be operated out of doors and never inside confined spaces.  Lifting injuries  Workers involved in flood preparation and cleanup activities are at risk of back, knee, and shoulder injuries from manual lifting and handling of building materials, sandbags, and fallen tree limbs. To help prevent injuries, use proper lifting techniques and teams of two or more to move bulky and heavy items.  Mold - QuickCard™ | Español | [More...]  Mold can often be recognized by sight or smell. It may appear as colored woolly mats, or it may produce a foul, musty, earthy smell. Mold exposure can cause sneezing, runny nose, eye irritation, cough and congestion, aggravation of asthma, and dermatitis (skin rash). Individuals with allergies, asthma, sinusitis, or other lung diseases and individuals with weakened immune systems are at the greatest risk of health effects from exposure to mold.  What precautions should be taken when cleaning up mold?  Identify and correct moisture problems. Make sure that work areas are well ventilated. Use hand, eye, and respiratory protection. A N-95 respirator is recommended. Discard mold damaged materials in plastic bags. Clean wet items and surfaces with detergent and water. Disinfect cleaned surfaces with 1/4 to 1 1/2 cup household bleach in 1 gallon of water. CAUTION: Do not mix bleach with other cleaning products that contain ammonia.  Rodents, Snakes and Insects - QuickCard™ | Español  What precautions should be taken against insects?  To protect yourself from biting and stinging insects, wear long pants, socks, and long-sleeved shirts. Use insect repellents that contain DEET or Picaridin. Treat bites and stings with over-the-counter products that relieve pain and prevent infection. Watch out for fire ants; their bites are painful and cause blisters. Severe reactions to fire ant bites (chest pain, nausea, sweating, loss of breath, serious swelling or slurred speech) require immediate medical treatment.  What precautions should be taken against rodents and wild or stray animals?  Dead and live animals can spread diseases such as Rat Bite Fever and Rabies. Avoid contact with wild or stray animals. Avoid contact with rats or rat-contaminated buildings, and if you can’t avoid contact, wear protective gloves and wash your hands regularly. Get rid of dead animals as soon as possible. If bitten/scratched, get medical attention immediately.  Watch where you place your hands and feet when removing debris. If possible, don’t place your fingers under debris you are moving. Wear heavy gloves. If you see a snake, step back and allow it to proceed. Wear boots at least 10 inches high. Watch for snakes sunning on fallen trees, limbs or other debris. A snake’s striking distance is about ½ the total length of the snake.  What steps should be taken if someone is bitten by a snake?  If bitten, note the color and shape of the snake’s head to help with treatment. Keep bite victims still and calm to slow the spread of venom in case the snake is poisonous. Seek medical attention as soon as possible. Do not cut the wound or attempt to suck out the venom. Apply first aid: lay the person down so that the bite is below the level of the heart, and cover the bite with a clean, dry dressing.  Chemical and biological hazards - Fact Sheet | Español  Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPG) and underground storage tanks, along with other chemical containers, may break away and float downstream, causing hazards from their released contents. Floodwaters may also contain biohazards due to direct contamination by untreated raw sewage, dead animals, rotting food, etc. Avoiding contact, good personal hygiene practices, medical surveillance, and discarding all food that comes in contact with flood waters are all important controls.  Fire - Fact Sheet  Floods can damage fire protection systems, delay response times of emergency responders and disrupt water distribution systems. All of these factors lead to increased dangers from fire and decreasing firefighter capabilities.  Drowning  Anytime workers are exposed to moving water, their chances for accidental drowning increase. Even good swimmers are easily overcome by swift-moving water. Workers should not work alone and should wear a Coast Guard-approved personal flotation device (PFD) when working in or near water.  Hypothermia  Hypothermia is a condition brought on when the body temperature drops to less than 95°F. Standing or working in water that is cooler than 75°F will remove body heat more rapidly than it can be replaced, resulting in hypothermia. Symptoms of hypothermia include uncontrollable shivering, slow speech, memory lapses, frequent stumbling, drowsiness, and exhaustion.  Workers should select proper clothing for cold, wet, and windy conditions. This should include dry clothing, underwear that will keep water away from the skin (polypropylene), layers of clothing to adjust to changing environmental temperatures, and a hat and gloves. Take frequent short breaks in warm dry shelters to allow the body to warm up. Perform work during the warmest part of the day. Avoid exhaustion or fatigue because energy is needed to keep muscles warm. Use the buddy system (work in pairs). Drink warm, sweet beverages (sugar water, sports-type drinks). Avoid drinks with caffeine (coffee, tea, or hot chocolate) or alcohol. Eat warm, high-calorie foods like hot pasta dishes.  Exhaustion - Extended/Unusual Work Shifts  Workers involved in response operations are often called upon to work extended hours under stressful conditions. This working environment increases the risk of injury due to inattentiveness and also makes workers more vulnerable to stress-induced illness and disease.  Heat - QuickCard™ | Español | Fact Sheet | Español | [More...]  What are Heat Stroke and Heat Exhaustion and what are the symptoms?  Heat Stroke is the most serious heat-related health problem. Heat stroke occurs when the body's temperature regulating system fails and body temperature rises to critical levels (greater than 104°F).This is a medical emergency that may result in death! The signs of heat stroke are confusion, loss of consciousness and seizures. Workers experiencing heat stroke have a very high body temperature and may stop sweating.  Heat Exhaustion is the next most serious heat-related health problem. The signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion are headache, nausea, dizziness, weakness, irritability, confusion, thirst, heavy sweating and a body temperature greater than 100.4°F.  What steps should be taken if workers show signs of heat stroke or heat stress?  Call a supervisor for help. If the supervisor is not available, call 911. Have someone stay with the worker until help arrives. Move the worker to a cooler/shaded area. Remove outer clothing. Fan and mist the worker with water; apply ice (ice bags or ice towels). Provide cool drinking water, if the worker is able to drink. What precautions should be taken to protect against heat illness?  To protect workers from heat stress, employers should:  Provide training about the hazards leading to heat stress and how to prevent them. Provide a lot of cool water to workers close to the work area. At least one pint of water per hour is needed. Schedule frequent rest periods with water breaks in shaded or air-conditioned areas. Routinely check workers who are at risk of heat stress due to protective clothing and high temperature. Consider protective clothing that provides cooling. Workers should take the following steps to protect themselves from heat illness:  Know signs/symptoms of heat illnesses; monitor yourself; use a buddy system. Block out direct sun and other heat sources. Drink plenty of fluids. Drink often and BEFORE you are thirsty. Avoid beverages containing alcohol or caffeine. Wear lightweight, light colored, loosefitting clothes. Be aware that poor physical condition, some health problems (such as high blood pressure or diabetes), pregnancy, colds and flu, and some medications can increase your personal risk. If you are under treatment, ask your healthcare provider. Additional Information For more information on flood response and recovery issues, visit the following resources:  After a Flood.

ready.gov	https://www.ready.gov/floods	National	NA	English	Flood Warning	Failing to evacuate flooded areas, entering flood waters, or remaining after a flood has passed can result in injury or death. Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the United States. Floods may:  Result from rain, snow, coastal storms, storm surges, and overflows of dams and other water systems.  Develop slowly or quickly – Flash floods can come with no warning.  Cause outages, disrupt transportation, damage buildings, and create landslides.   IF YOU ARE UNDER A FLOOD WARNING, FIND SAFE SHELTER RIGHT AWAY  Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around, Don’t Drown!  Just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.  Stay off of bridges over fast-moving water.  Determine how best to protect yourself based on the type of flooding.  Evacuate if told to do so.  Move to higher ground or a higher floor.  Stay where you are.  HOW TO STAY SAFE WHEN A FLOOD THREATENS  Prepare NOW Know types of flood risk in your area. Visit FEMA’s Flood Map Service Center for information.  Sign up for your community’s warning system. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio also provide emergency alerts.  If flash flooding is a risk in your location, then monitor potential signs, such as heavy rain.  Learn and practice evacuation routes, shelter plans, and flash flood response.  Gather supplies in case you have to leave immediately, or if services are cut off. Keep in mind each person’s specific needs, including medication. Don’t forget the needs of pets. Obtain extra batteries and charging devices for phones and other critical equipment.  Purchase or renew a flood insurance policy. It typically takes up to 30 days for a policy to go into effect and can protect the life you've built. Homeowner’s policies do not cover flooding. Get flood coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)  Keep important documents in a waterproof container. Create password-protected digital copies.  Protect your property. Move valuables to higher levels. Declutter drains and gutters. Install check valves. Consider a sump pump with a battery.  Survive DURING Depending on where you are, and the impact and the warning time of flooding, go to the safe location that you previously identified. If told to evacuate, do so immediately. Never drive around barricades. Local responders use them to safely direct traffic out of flooded areas. Listen to EAS, NOAA Weather Radio, or local alerting systems for current emergency information and instructions. Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around. Don’t Drown! Stay off bridges over fast-moving water. Fast-moving water can wash bridges away without warning. If your vehicle is trapped in rapidly moving water, then stay inside. If water is rising inside the vehicle, then seek refuge on the roof. If trapped in a building, then go to its highest level. Do not climb into a closed attic. You may become trapped by rising floodwater. Go on the roof only if necessary. Once there, signal for help. Be Safe AFTER Listen to authorities for information and instructions. Return home only when authorities say it is safe. Avoid driving, except in emergencies. Snakes and other animals may be in your house. Wear heavy gloves and boots during clean up. Be aware of the risk of electrocution. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water. If it is safe to do so, turn off the electricity to prevent electric shock. Avoid wading in floodwater, which can contain dangerous debris and be contaminated. Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water. Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery ONLY outdoors and away from windows.
ready.gov	https://www.ready.gov/es/inundaciones	National	NA	Spanish	Flood Warning	No evacuar las áreas inundadas, adentrarse en aguas de inundación o quedarse después de que haya pasado una inundación puede resultar en lesioneso la muerte. Las inundaciones son desbordamientos temporales de agua hacia terrenos que normalmente están secos. Las inundaciones son el desastre natural más común en los Estados Unidos. Las inundaciones pueden:  Producirse como consecuencia de lluvia, nieve, tormentas costeras, marejadas ciclónicas, desbordamientos de represas y otros sistemas de agua. Desarrollarse de manera lenta o rápida. Las inundaciones repentinas pueden ocurrir sin advertencia. Producir la pérdida de la electricidad, interrumpir el transporte, dañar edificios y crear deslizamientos de tierra SI SE ENCUENTRA BAJO UNA ADVERTENCIA DE INUNDACIÓN, BUSQUE UN REFUGIO SEGURO INMEDIATAMENTE  No camine, no nade ni maneje en aguas de inundación. ¡Dé la vuelta, no se ahogue! (Turn Around, Don’t Drown®) Solo bastan seis pulgadas de agua en movimiento para derribarle, y un pie de agua para que el torrente arrastre el vehículo. Manténgase alejado de puentes sobre aguas en movimiento rápido. Determine cómo protegerse mejor basado en el tipo de inundación. Desaloje si le indican que lo haga. Diríjase a un terreno más elevado o a un piso más alto. Quédese donde está. CÓMO MANTENERSE SEGURO ANTE AMENAZAS DE INUNDACIÓN QUÉ HACER AHORA: Prepararse Conozca los tipos de riesgo de inundación de su área. Visite el Centro de Servicio de Mapas de Inundación de FEMA para obtener información. Inscríbase para recibir mensajes del sistema de advertencia de su comunidad. El Sistema de Alerta de Emergencia (EAS, por sus siglas en inglés) y la radio meteorológica de la Administración Nacional Oceánica y Atmosférica (NOAA, por sus siglas en inglés) también proveen alertas de emergencia. Si las inundaciones repentinas son un riesgo en su localidad, esté atento y monitoree las señales potenciales de inundación; por ejemplo, lluvia intensa. Apréndase y practique las rutas de desalojo, los planes de refugio y la respuesta ante una inundación repentina. Junte y tenga suministros preparados en caso de que tenga que salir inmediatamente o por si se producen cortes en los servicios públicos. Tenga presente las necesidades específicas de cada persona, incluidos los medicamentos. No se olvide de las necesidades de las mascotas. Consiga baterías o pilas adicionales y dispositivos de carga para los teléfonos y otros equipos críticos. Compre o renueve su póliza de seguro contra inundaciones. Normalmente, una póliza tarda aproximadamente 30 días para entrar en vigencia y puede proteger la vida que ha construido. Las pólizas del seguro para propietarios de vivienda no cubren las inundaciones. Consiga cobertura contra inundación bajo el Programa del Seguro Nacional de Inundación (NFIP, por sus siglas en inglés). Mantenga los documentos importantes en una caja hermética. Cree copias digitales protegidas con contraseña. Proteja su propiedad. Mueva los objetos de valor a los niveles más altos. Despeje los desagües y canaletas. Instale válvulas de retención. Considere una bomba de sumidero con batería. QUÉ HACER DURANTE: Sobrevivir Dependiendo del lugar donde se encuentre, y de la magnitud y el tiempo de advertencia de la inundación, diríjase al lugar seguro que identificó previamente. Si le indican que desaloje, hágalo inmediatamente. Nunca maneje alrededor de barreras. El personal de respuesta local las utiliza para dirigir el tránsito de manera segura hacia las zonas alejadas de la inundación. Escuche la radio meteorológica del EAS, la NOAA o los sistemas de alerta locales para recibir información e instrucciones oficiales sobre la emergencia. No camine, no nade ni maneje en aguas de inundación. ¡Dé la vuelta, no se ahogue! (Turn Around, Don’t Drown®) Manténgase alejado de puentes sobre aguas en movimiento rápido. Las aguas en movimiento rápido pueden arrastrar puentes sin advertencia. Si su vehículo se queda atrapado en aguas en movimiento rápido, quédese en el interior del vehículo. Si el agua comienza a subir en el interior del vehículo, busque refugiarse sobre el techo. Si queda atrapado en el interior de un edificio, diríjase a su nivel más alto. Nunca suba a un ático cerrado. Podría quedar atrapado por el aumento del nivel del agua de inundación. Súbase al techo si es necesario. Una vez allí, haga señas para pedir ayuda. QUÉ HACER DESPUÉS: Estar a salvo Escuche la información y las instrucciones de las autoridades. Regrese a casa solo cuando las autoridades le indiquen que es seguro hacerlo. Evite manejar, salvo en casos extremos de emergencia. Podrían haber culebras y otros animales en su casa. Use guantes gruesos y botas durante la limpieza. Tenga presente el riesgo de electrocución. No toque los equipos eléctricos si están mojados o si usted se encuentra sobre el agua. Si es seguro hacerlo, desconecte la electricidad para impedir para prevenir descargas eléctricas. Evite caminar en aguas de inundación, ya que pueden contener residuos peligrosos y estar contaminadas. Los cables subterráneos o caídos también pueden energizar el agua. Use un generador u otro equipo a gasolina SOLO al aire libre y alejado de las ventanas.
Yavapai County website	https://www.yavapaiaz.gov/Resident-Services/Flood-Control/Flood-Safety	Yavapai County	NA	English	Flood Warning	Flood Safety Flood warnings are forecasts of impending floods and are distributed to the public by radio and television, by NOAA weather radio, and through local Yavapai County Emergency Management. The warning message tells the expected degree of flooding. Careful preparation and prompt response will reduce property loss and ensure personal safety. For information on the ALERT System, visit Flood Warning System.  There are techniques, known as retrofitting, which help protect existing buildings from flooding; such as, elevating the structure above flood levels, floodwalls, dry and/or wet floodproofing and sewer backup protection. The District can assist you in choosing the most appropriate measure.  Some rules to follow: Never attempt to drive through water on a road. Water can be deeper than it appears, and water levels can rise very quickly. Know the elevation of your property in relation to nearby streams and other waterways. Make advance plans of what you will do and where you will go in a flash flood emergency. Listen to area radio and television stations and NOAA weather radio. Be prepared to move out of danger’s way; if you are on the road, watch for flooding at highway dips, bridges, and low areas. Stay away from natural streambeds, arroyos, and other drainage channels during and after rainstorms. Watch for signs of distant heavy rainfall. Keep children away from floodwaters near culverts and storm drains. Protect property with sand bags, relocate or elevate items of personal or economic value. Disconnect and/or move equipment, appliances. Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood dangers. Pets - Plan for pet disaster needs. If you evacuate your home take your pets with you, if possible; or plan in advance for shelter alternatives.

Arizona Emergency Information Network	https://ein.az.gov/hazards/flooding	Arizona	NA	English	Flood Warning	Flooding Flooding, the temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry, is the most common hazard in the United States and Arizona. Failing to evacuate flooded areas, entering flood waters, or remaining after a flood has passed can result in injury or death. Floods can be local, impacting a neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins and multiple states. Flooding can cause power outages, traffic issues, damage to buildings and landslides.  Floods may develop slowly over time, or quickly with no warning as in a flash flood.  Flash floods often have a dangerous wall of roaring water carrying rocks, mud and other debris.   Anywhere it rains, it can flood. Be aware of flood hazards(link is external) no matter where you live or work, but especially if you are in low-lying areas, near water, behind a levee or downstream from a dam. Even small streams, gullies, creeks, culverts, dry streambeds or low-lying ground that appear harmless in dry weather can flood.      BEFORE Familiarize yourself with these terms to help identify a flood hazard:  Flood Watch—Flooding is possible. Tune in to NOAA Weather Radio(link is external), commercial radio or television for information. Flash Flood Watch—Flash flooding is possible. Be prepared to move to higher ground; listen to NOAA Weather Radio, commercial radio or television for information. Flood Warning—Flooding is occurring or will occur soon; if advised to evacuate, do so immediately. Flash Flood Warning—A flash flood is occurring; seek higher ground on foot immediately.   Build an emergency go kit and make a family communication plan.  Know types of flood risk in your area. Visit FEMA’s Flood Map Service Center(link is external) for information.  Sign up for your community’s warning system. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio also provide emergency alerts.  Keep important documents in a waterproof container. Create password-protected digital copies.  Protect your property. Move valuables to higher levels. Declutter drains and gutters. Install check valves. Consider a sump pump with a battery.  Purchase or renew a flood insurance policy. It typically takes up to 30 days for a policy to go into effect and can protect the life you've built. Homeowner’s policies do not cover flooding. Get flood coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program(link is external) (NFIP)        DURING  If told to evacuate, do so immediately. Never drive around barricades. Local responders use them to safely direct traffic out of flooded areas.  Listen to the Emergency Alert System, NOAA Weather Radio or local alerting systems for current emergency information and instructions.  Be aware of stream, drainage channels, canyons and other areas known to flood suddenly. Flash floods can occur in these areas with or without typical warnings such as rain clouds or heavy rain.  Move immediately to higher ground. Do not walk through moving water. Six inches of moving water can make you fall. If you have to walk in water, walk where the water is not moving. Use a stick to check the firmness of the ground in front of you.  Do not drive into flooded areas. If floodwaters rise around your car, abandon the car and move to higher ground if you can do so safely.  Just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away. Stay off of bridges over fast-moving water.  Do not camp or park your vehicle along streams, rivers or creeks, particularly during threatening conditions. If trapped in a building, then go to its highest level. Do not climb into a closed attic. You may become trapped by rising floodwater. Go on the roof only if necessary. Once there, signal for help.        AFTER Listen to authorities for information and instructions. Return home only when authorities say it is safe.  Use local alerts and warning systems to get information and expert advice.  Avoid moving water.  Avoid driving, except in emergencies.  Stay away from damaged areas unless your assistance has been requested by police, fire, or a relief organization.  Stay off the roads and out of the way of emergency workers.  Listen for local warnings and information.  If you must walk or drive in areas that have been flooded:   Stay on firm ground. Moving water only 6 inches deep can sweep you off your feet. Standing water may be electrically charged from underground or downed power lines.  Use extreme caution when entering buildings; there may be hidden damage, particularly in foundations.  Be aware of the risk of electrocution. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water.

National Weather Service	https://www.weather.gov/safety/hurricane-plan	National	NA	English	Hurricane Warning	The best time to prepare for a hurricane is before hurricane season begins on June 1. It is vital to understand your home's vulnerability to storm surge, flooding, and wind. Here is your checklist of things to do BEFORE hurricane seasons begins.  Know your zone: Do you live near the Gulf or Atlantic Coasts? Find out if you live in a hurricane evacuation area by contacting your local government/emergency management office or by checking the evacuation site website. Put Together an Emergency Kit: Put together a basic emergency. Check emergency equipment, such as flashlights, generators and storm shutters. Write or review your Family Emergency Plan: Before an emergency happens, sit down with your family or close friends and decide how you will get in contact with each other, where you will go, and what you will do in an emergency. Keep a copy of this plan in your emergency supplies kit or another safe place where you can access it in the event of a disaster. Start at the Ready.Gov emergency plan webpage. Review Your Insurance Policies: Review your insurance policies to ensure that you have adequate coverage for your home and personal property. Understand NWS forecast products, especially the meaning of NWS watches and warnings. Preparation tips for your home from the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes Preparation Tips for those with Chronic Illnesses
ready.gov	https://www.ready.gov/hurricanes	National	11/17/2022	English	Hurricane Warning	Hurricanes are dangerous and can cause major damage from storm surge, wind damage, rip currents and flooding. They can happen along any U.S. coast or in any territory in the Atlantic or Pacific oceans. Storm surge historically is the leading cause of hurricane-related deaths in the United States.  Eastern Pacific Hurricane Season: May 15-November 30.  Atlantic Hurricane Season: June 1-November 30.  Central Pacific Hurricane Season: June 1-November 30.  Prepare for Hurricanes Know Your Hurricane Risk  Hurricanes are not just a coastal problem. Find out how rain, wind, water and even tornadoes could happen far inland from where a hurricane or tropical storm makes landfall. Start preparing now.  Make an Emergency Plan  Make sure everyone in your household knows and understands your hurricane plans. Include the office, kids’ day care, and anywhere else you frequent in your hurricane plans. Ensure your business has a continuity plan to continue operating when disaster strikes.  Know your Evacuation Zone  You may have to evacuate quickly due to a hurricane if you live in an evacuation zone. Learn your evacuation routes, practice with your household and pets, and identify where you will stay.   Follow the instructions from local emergency managers, who work closely with state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies and partners. They will provide the latest recommendations based on the threat to your community and appropriate safety measures. Recognize Warnings and Alerts  Have several ways to receive alerts. Download the FEMA app and receive real-time alerts from the National Weather Service for up to five locations nationwide. Sign up for community alerts in your area and be aware of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA), which require no sign up.  Those with Disabilities  Identify if you may need additional help during an emergency if you or anyone else in your household is an individual with a disability.  Review Important Documents  Make sure your insurance policies and personal documents, such as ID, are up to date. Make copies and keep them in a secure password-protected digital space.  Strengthen your Home  De-clutter drains and gutters, bring in outside furniture, and consider hurricane shutters.  Get Tech Ready  Keep your cell phone charged when you know a hurricane is in the forecast and purchase backup charging devices to power electronics.  Help your Neighborhood  Check with neighbors, senior adults, or those who may need additional help securing hurricane plans to see how you can be of assistance to others  Gather Supplies  Have enough supplies for your household, include medication, disinfectant supplies and pet supplies in your go bag or car trunk. You may not have access to these supplies for days or even weeks after a hurricane.  Stay Safe During a Hurricane Stay Informed  Pay attention to emergency information and alerts. If you live in a mandatory evacuation zone and local officials tell you to evacuate, do so immediately. Dealing with the Weather  Determine how best to protect yourself from high winds and flooding. Take refuge in a designated storm shelter or an interior room for high winds. Go to the highest level of the building if you are trapped by flooding. Do not climb into a closed attic. You may become trapped by rising flood water. Do not walk, swim or drive through flood waters. Turn Around. Don’t Drown! Just six inches of fast-moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away. Returning Home After a Hurricane Pay attention to local officials for information and special instructions. Be careful during clean up. Wear protective clothing, use appropriate face coverings or masks if cleaning mold or other debris. People with asthma and other lung conditions and/or immune suppression should not enter buildings with indoor water leaks or mold growth that can be seen or smelled, even if these individuals are not allergic to mold. Children should not help with disaster cleanup work. Wear protective clothing and work with someone else. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water. If it is safe to do so, turn off electricity at the main breaker or fuse box to prevent electric shock. Do not wade in flood water, which can contain dangerous pathogens that cause illnesses. This water also can contain debris, chemicals, waste and wildlife. Underground or downed power lines also can electrically charge the water. Save phone calls for emergencies. Phone systems often are down or busy after a disaster. Use text messages or social media to communicate with family and friends. Document any property damage with photographs. Contact your insurance company for assistance.

Pueden ocurrir a lo largo de cualquier costa de los EE. UU. o en cualquier territorio en los océanos Atlántico o Pacífico. Las marejadas ciclónicas, históricamente, son la causa principal de las muertes relacionadas con los huracanes en los Estados Unidos.  Temporada de huracanes del Pacífico Oriental: 15 de mayo al 30 de noviembre.  Temporada de huracanes del Atlántico: 1 de junio al 30 de noviembre.  Temporada de huracanes del Pacífico Central: 1 de junio al 30 de noviembre.  Cómo prepararse para los huracanes Conozca su riesgo a huracanes  Los huracanes no son solamente un problema en la costa. Conozca cómo la lluvia, los vientos, el agua y hasta los tornados podrían llegar tierra adentro, muy lejos de donde el huracán o la tormenta tropical toca tierra. Empiece a prepararse ahora.  Haga un plan para emergencias  Asegúrese de que todos los miembros de su hogar sepan y comprendan sus planes para huracanes. Incluya su lugar de trabajo, la guardería infantil y todo otro lugar que visite con frecuencia en sus planes para huracanes. Asegúrese de que su negocio cuente con un plan de continuidad para continuar sus operaciones cuando ocurra un desastre.  Conozca su zona de desalojo  Si usted vive en una zona de desalojo, podría tener que desalojar rápidamente por un huracán. Aprenda sus rutas de desalojo, ensaye el desalojo con su familia y sus mascotas e identifique dónde se alojará.   Siga las indicaciones de los funcionarios locales de manejo de emergencias, quienes trabajan estrechamente con las agencias estatales, locales, tribales y territoriales y otros colaboradores. Éstos proveerán las recomendaciones más actualizadas según el nivel de amenaza que su comunidad afronta y las medidas de seguridad correspondientes. Reconozca los avisos y las alertas  Debe tener varias maneras de recibir mensajes de alerta. Descargue la aplicación móvil de FEMA para recibir alertas en tiempo real del Servicio Nacional Meteorológico para hasta cinco lugares en cualquier parte de la nación. Inscríbase para recibir alertas comunitarias en su área y tenga en cuenta el Sistema de Alerta en Emergencias (EAS, por sus siglas en inglés) y el sistema de Alertas Inalámbricas de Emergencia (WEA, por sus siglas en inglés), los cuales no requieren que se inscriba.  Personas con discapacidades  Identifique su necesidad de ayuda adicional durante una emergencia si usted o alguien de su familia es una persona con alguna discapacidad.  Verifique sus documentos importantes  Asegúrese de que sus pólizas de seguro y documentos personales,  como sus documentos de identificación, estén al día. Debe hacer copias de estos documentos y guardarlas en un espacio digital protegido con contraseña.  Refuerce su vivienda  Limpie los desagües y canaletas, guarde los muebles del exterior y considere la posibilidad de instalar tormenteras.  Prepárese con la tecnología  Mantenga su teléfono celular cargado cuando sepa que un huracán se encuentra en el pronóstico y compre dispositivos de carga de reserva para mantener sus electrónicos con energía.  Ayude a su vecindario  Hable con sus vecinos, adultos mayores o las personas que podrían necesitar ayuda adicional sobre sus planes para huracanes. Así podrá conocer cómo puede ayudar a los demás.  Recolecte suministros  Debe contar con suficientes suministros para su hogar e incluir los medicamentos, suministros de desinfección, y suministros para mascotas en su mochila de emergencia o en su vehículo. Después de un huracán, es posible que no tenga acceso estos suministros durante días o hasta semanas.  Manténgase a salvo durante un huracán feature_mini img Manténgase informado  Preste atención a la información y alertas de emergencia. Si vive en una zona de desalojo obligatorio y los funcionarios locales indican que debe desalojar, hágalo de inmediato. Cómo lidiar con las condiciones del tiempo  Si tiene que ir a un refugio comunitario o grupal, no se le olvide seguir las últimas directrices de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés) para protegerse a sí mismo y a su familia contra COVID-19. Asegúrese de revisar su plan de desalojo anterior y considerar alternativas para mantener el distanciamiento físico y prevenir la propagación de COVID-19, y actualice su plan según sea necesario.  Si tiene que desalojar, si es posible, lleve consigo los artículos que pueden ayudar a protegerse a sí mismo y a otras personas en el refugio contra COVID-19, como desinfectante para manos, materiales de limpieza y dos mascarillas limpias y bien ajustadas con dos o más capas para cada persona. Volver a casa después de un huracán Preste atención a los funcionarios locales para recibir información e instrucciones especiales. Tenga cuidado durante la limpieza. Póngase ropa protectora y use coberturas faciales o mascarillas apropiadas si estará limpiando moho u otros escombros. Las personas con asma y otras afecciones pulmonares y/o supresión inmunológica no deben entrar en edificios con goteras en el interior o crecimientos de moho que se pueden ver u oler, incluso si estas personas no son alérgicas al moho. Los niños no deben ayudar con el trabajo de limpieza después de los desastres. Use ropa protectora y trabaje con otra persona. No toque ningún equipo eléctrico si está mojado o si usted está parado en el agua. Si es seguro hacerlo, interrumpa la electricidad en la caja principal de disyuntores o fusibles para evitar descargas eléctricas. No atraviese las aguas de inundación, las cuales pueden contener patógenos peligrosos que causan enfermedades. El agua también puede contener escombros, químicos, residuos y animales silvestres. Además, los cables eléctricos subterráneos o caídos podrían cargar el agua con energía eléctrica. Solamente debe hacer llamadas telefónicas para emergencias. Frecuentemente, los sistemas telefónicos no funcionan o están sobrecargados después de un desastre. Use mensajes de texto o las redes sociales para comunicarse con su familia y amistades. Documente todos los daños a la propiedad con fotografías. Comuníquese con su compañía de seguros para obtener asistencia.
FEMA	https://www.weather.gov/safety/hurricane-plan	National	NA	English	Hurricane Warning	Be Prepared for a Hurricane Hurricanes are massive storm systems that form over warm ocean waters and move toward land. The Atlantic and Central Pacific hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, with peak occurring between mid-August and late October. The Eastern Pacific hurricane season begins May 15 and ends November 30.  All of this information can be found on the hazard's Information Sheet.  Quick Facts Can happen along any U.S. coast or territory in the Atlantic or Pacific. Can affect areas more than 100 miles inland.  Most active in September.  Words to Know Eye: A circular area at center of the hurricane where the winds are lighter. Inland: Away from the coastline. Tropics: Regions of the earth that lie roughly in the middle of the globe. Storm Surge: An abnormal rise in water created by the storm when water is pushed toward the shore by the force of the winds that spin in circles around the storm. Evacuation: Leaving an area declared unsafe by officials. Always follow instructions to evacuate your home or neighborhood and if need be to go someplace safer.  Protect Yourself Key Messages Know your evacuation zone. If you are under a hurricane warning, hurricane conditions are expected in your area. Complete storm preparations and immediately leave the threatened area if directed to by local officials. If you are under a hurricane watch, hurricane conditions are possible. Review your emergency and evacuation plans and pay attention to local officials’ directions. Determine your best protection for high winds and flooding. Evacuate if told to do so. Take shelter in a designated storm shelter or an interior room for high winds. Listen for emergency information and alerts. Only use generators outdoors and away from windows. Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters.  Featured Protective Actions Evacuate if advised. Avoid walking or driving in floodwaters; depth and velocity are not always obvious; the ground or road may suddenly wash away and hidden dangers may exist. Seek high ground (for flash flooding) or stay on high ground. Get inside (for high winds); seek shelter in safe room based on FEMA standards, storm shelter based on International Code Council (ICC) 500 standards, or sturdy building in a small windowless room on the lowest floor safe from flooding (for high winds).
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration	https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline/disaster-types/hurricanes-tropical-storms	National	6/9/2023	English	Hurricane Warning	Hurricanes and Tropical Storms Body Hurricanes are types of tropical storms that form in the southern Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and eastern Pacific Ocean. Hurricanes affect millions of people who live along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts each year. Parts of the Southwest United States and the Pacific Coast can also experience severe weather associated with hurricanes, which include tornadoes, floods, and heavy winds.  It’s normal for hurricanes to cause people to experience emotional distress. Feelings such as overwhelming anxiety, constant worrying, trouble sleeping, and other depression-like symptoms are common responses before, during, and after these types of storms. Other signs of emotional distress related to hurricanes include:  Fearing that forecasted storms may develop into a hurricane even when the chances they will are low Constant yelling or fighting with family and friends Having thoughts, memories, or nightmares related to the storm that you can’t seem to get out of your head These are just a few warning signs of disaster-related distress. Learn more about warning signs and risk factors for emotional distress related to hurricanes and other disasters.  Where Can I Get Help? The Disaster Distress Helpline (DDH) is the first national hotline dedicated to providing year-round disaster crisis counseling. This toll-free, multilingual, crisis support service is available 24/7 to all residents in the U.S. and its territories who are experiencing emotional distress related to natural or human-caused disasters.   Call or text 1-800-985-5990  Who is at Risk for Emotional Distress? Forecasts for hurricanes and tropical storms can last for days as they take shape. People living in hurricane-prone areas as well as anyone who has struggled to recover from experiences with past storms may be vulnerable to distress before the event occurs. Other people at risk for emotional distress due to these types of storms include:  Children and teens. After a hurricane, young people may worry that another tropical storm will happen again. They may become overly dependent, have trouble eating and sleeping, or show physical symptoms such as stomachaches and headaches. Older adults. Older adults are more likely to need social support to reduce the effects of stress and move forward on the path of recovery. Some older adults may also be dealing with the loss of physical capabilities and possibly independence. First responders and recovery workers. These individuals may experience prolonged separation from loved ones (depending on the severity of the storm or hurricane) and show signs of mental fatigue. Once warnings and evacuation orders are issued, the risk for emotional distress becomes greater:  You may feel unprepared, isolated, overwhelmed, or confused. Uncertainty about where to go during a hurricane, how to keep your pets safe, or whether you will be able to continue taking any medications can cause emotional distress. You may lose contact with a loved one in an impacted area due to power and Internet outages. You may experience difficult memories and emotions associated with similar traumatic experiences in the past. If you are relocated, being in an unfamiliar environment can be difficult, especially for people with limited physical mobility, economic means, or knowledge of the English language. Returning to a home, business, school, or place of worship impacted by a hurricane may cause additional distress, especially if there is structural damage. A temporary or permanent loss of employment may also occur.  Remember, too, that the anniversary of a disaster or tragic event can renew feelings of fear, anxiety, and sadness in disaster survivors. Certain smells or sounds, such as smoke or sirens, can also trigger emotional distress. These and other environmental sensations can take people right back to the event, or cause them to fear that it’s about to happen again. These “trigger events” can happen at any time.  People can experience a wide range of emotions before and after a disaster or traumatic event. There’s no right or wrong way to feel. However, it’s important to find healthy ways to cope when these events happen. Learn about coping tips for dealing with hurricanes, tropical storms, and other types of disasters.

National Child Traumatic Stress Network	https://www.nctsn.org/what-is-child-trauma/trauma-types/disasters/hurricane-resources	National	NA	English	Hurricane Warning	Definition A hurricane is a large, rotating tropical storm with powerful wind and heavy rains that can cause storm surges, flooding, mudslides, and tornadoes. Hurricanes gather heat and energy through contact with warm ocean waters, and the most severe weather is around the eye of the storm, which can be up to thirty miles wide. A hurricane can last more than two weeks and can travel up the entire length of the eastern coast. Hurricanes usually occur between June 1 through November 30 in the Atlantic Ocean, with August and September being the peak months. These storms are called typhoons in the Northwest Pacific and cyclones in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean. Hurricanes affect entire communities, often with extensive damage. Before Being prepared beforehand is the best way to help children and family members recover after a hurricane. Communities prone to hurricanes are encouraged to get their residents prepared before the hurricane season begins. Hurricanes are often tracked for weeks before reaching land, providing early warnings and time to prepare. To improve their preparedness, families should:  Be informed about their hurricane risk, how to access updated hurricane information, and whether their property is insured. Families should know their risk for flooding and best evacuation routes; what official radio stations, websites, and/or social media will provide hurricane updates; and whether or not they have adequate flood insurance. Encourage families to contact their communities’ emergency preparedness office if they have any members who have ongoing health concerns or if they will need assistance during evacuations. Help families to understand the different hurricane alerts: Hurricane Watch: Hurricane conditions are possible in the watch area within the next 36 hours. Hurricane Warning: Hurricane conditions are expected in the warning area within 24 hours. Coastal Flood Watch: The possibility exists for the inundation of land areas along the coast within the next 12 to 36 hours. Coastal Flood Warning: Land areas along the coast are expected to become—or have become—inundated by seawater above the typical tide action. Assemble an emergency go kit. Families should have access to enough water, food, and other emergency supplies for at least 3 days and medications for at least 7 days. Families should also include copies of important documents, a radio with batteries to get weather updates, and supplies for pets. Keep supplies in a large backpack, duffel bag, or easy to carry container in the event the family has to evacuate quickly. Children can also pack their own kits and include their favorite toys. Review the family preparedness plan for additional guidance. Prepare their property. Families should regularly trim trees and shrubs around their homes and clear rain gutters and downspouts. Make a family communication plan. Families should have important contact information easily accessible and know whom they might stay with in the event that they need to evacuate. Make sure babysitters are also aware of this plan. As a family, fill out the preparedness wallet card. Plan for children’s needs. Families should give children factual information about hurricanes in simple terms. Encourage parents to include children in preparedness activities. The Help Kids Cope app provides parents with tips for how to talk with children of different developmental levels. During Knowing what to do right before and during a hurricane can help families feel more in control and take steps to increase their safety. Parents and caregivers should consider the following when responding to a hurricane.  During a hurricane watch, families should:  Stay informed about hurricane alerts and current weather updates. Check that their emergency supplies are updated and implement preparedness plans. Activities should include having enough food and water, contacting individuals they plan to stay with if evacuated, and securing their property. Monitor their risk and evacuate as needed. Families should follow all evacuation instructions from local authorities. Families should consider evacuating if they live in an area prone to flooding or have a family member that may be affected by being without power for an extended period (e.g., health issues, very young children). During an evacuation, families should:  Gather their emergency go kit, all loved ones, and pets in their car. If they are using shared transportation, identify the pickup areas and make sure the route to that location is safe. Families should also communicate with someone outside the storm area about where they are going. Seek updated information on evacuation conditions. Families should check to see if any evacuation routes are blocked and what traffic congestion exists. Secure animals and leave property secured. Families should implement a plan for pets and livestock if they cannot evacuate as well and turn off utilities if instructed to do so. Locate a designated public shelter if needed. Families can text SHELTER and their zip code to 43362 (4FEMA) to find the nearest open shelter. They can also download the American Red Cross Shelter Finder app. Remain evacuated until authorities say it is safe to return. If sheltering in place during the storm, families should:  Monitor weather reports or check alerts to track the progress of the storm. Families should wait for official messages that the hurricane has passed before going outside. Extend food and water supplies. Families can maximize their supplies by keeping the refridgerator and freezer as cold as possible and only opening when necessary. Families can also store drinking water in clean bathtubs, jugs, bottles, and cooking pots. Be prepared to evacuate as needed. To address children’s reactions during a hurricane, parents and caregivers can:  Model calm behavior. Children may mirror the reactions of adults around them and will learn ideas for how to take care of themselves from what parents and caregivers do. Provide simple but accurate information in a steady voice. Encourage comforting or distracting activities. Children may benefit from doing slow breathing to calm their bodies, having a stuffed animal or blanket to hold, or being distracted from the storm by dancing, singing, or playing games. View these handouts for some ideas. Practice their own self-care. Parents and caregivers may benefit from finding opportunities to take a moment for themselves, express their feelings, acknowledge that it is a scary situation, and engage in a coping strategy. After After a hurricane, most families will recover over time, particularly with the support of family, friends, and organizations. The length of recovery depends, in part, on how frightened people were and the extent of the damage and loss in the community. Some families will be able to return to their normal routines rather quickly, while others will have to contend with repairing damage to their home and possessions, finding medical care, needing new employment, moving to a new community, and facing financial hardship. Some families will have lost a loved one or pet. Others will face multiple moves, and children may experience multiple placements in school.   Children will react differently to hurricanes depending on their age, developmental level, and prior experiences. Some typical reactions children may exhibit after a hurricane include the following: Concerns about safety: Children may worry about another hurricane or fear that regular summer storms will create significant devastation. They may also be anxious about being separated from their loved ones. Changes in behavior: Children can become clingy towards their parents or caregivers, have an increased activity level, experience difficulty concentrating or paying attention and become frustrated when they can’t remember something, and/or withdraw from others or stop participating in activities they previously enjoyed doing. Expression of physical ailments: Children may complain of headaches, stomachaches, or general pain. Changes in school/work performance and overall wellness: Children may show dramatic academic changes, such as changes in attendance and general functioning at school or work. They also may show changes in sleep, exercise, and their diet (e.g., what they eat and how much they eat). Children’s functioning and recovery will be influenced by how their parents and caregivers cope after the hurricane. Children often turn to adults for information, comfort, and help. To assist children, discuss with parents and caregivers ways to: Model how they handle stressful situations in front of their children. Provide accurate information to their children about what happened during the storm as well as what changes the family is facing. Answer questions honestly but with the amount of detail appropriate to their developmental level. Give themselves their own time to process what is happening. Keep family routines as regular as possible, even in the early recovery phase. Monitor the media and social media information children are viewing and set limits if children are overly focused on viewing this content. Seek additional help for themselves or their children if behavioral changes or reactions worsen or if they persist over six weeks after the hurricane.
OSHA	https://www.osha.gov/hurricane/preparedness	National	NA	English	Hurricane Warning	Hurricane Preparedness and Response Introduction Preparedness Response/Recovery OSHA Resources Additional Resources Emergency Preparedness and Response Workers' Rights Preparedness Planning It is important to have an evacuation plan in place to ensure that workers can get to safety in case a hurricane may affect the area. A thorough evacuation plan should include:  Conditions that will activate the plan Chain of command Emergency functions and who will perform them Specific evacuation procedures, including routes and exits Procedures for accounting for personnel, customers and visitors Equipment for personnel Some businesses are required to have an Emergency Action Plan meeting the requirements under 29 CFR 1910.38, see Evacuation Plans and Procedures eTool for more information. Ready.gov - Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has more information on evacuation plans as well as suggestions for precautions to take if you are unable to evacuate and do not have a safe room.  In addition to having evacuation plans in place, it is important to be familiar with the warning terms used for hurricanes, as well as your local community's emergency plans, warning signals, and shelters. Hurricane/Tropical Storm watches mean that a hurricane or tropical storm is possible in the specified area. Hurricane/Tropical Storm warnings mean that a hurricane or tropical storm is expected to reach the area, typically within 24 hours.  Be prepared to follow instructions from the local authorities and to evacuate if instructed to do so.  The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a 1 to 5 rating based on a hurricane's sustained wind speed. This scale estimates potential property damage. Hurricanes reaching Category 3 and higher are considered major hurricanes because of their potential for significant loss of life and damage. Category 1 and 2 storms are still dangerous, however, and require preparatory measures. In the western North Pacific, the term "super typhoon" is used for tropical cyclones with sustained winds exceeding 150 mph. This affects one or more U.S. territories ( i.e. Guam and the Mariana Islands).  Category  Sustained Winds  Types of Damage Due to Hurricane Winds  1  74-95 mph 64-82 kt 119-153 km/h Very dangerous winds will produce some damage: Well-constructed frame homes could have damage to roof, shingles, vinyl siding and gutters. Large branches of trees will snap and shallowly rooted trees may be toppled. Extensive damage to power lines and poles likely will result in power outages that could last a few to several days.  2  96-110 mph 83-95 kt 154-177 km/h Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage: Well-constructed frame homes could sustain major roof and siding damage. Many shallowly rooted trees will be snapped or uprooted and block numerous roads. Near-total power loss is expected with outages that could last from several days to weeks.  3 (major)  111-129 mph 96-112 kt 178-208 km/h Devastating damage will occur: Well-built framed homes may incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends. Many trees will be snapped or uprooted, blocking numerous roads. Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes.  4 (major)  130-156 mph 113-136 kt 209-251 km/h Catastrophic damage will occur: Well-built framed homes can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.  5 (major)  157 mph or higher 137 kt or higher 252 km/h or higher Catastrophic damage will occur: A high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.  Hurricane Intensity Scale Hurricane Intensity Scale (Wind Damage)  Employers whose workers will be involved in emergency response operations for releases of, or substantial threats of releases of, hazardous substances regardless of the location of the hazard must comply with OSHA’s Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standard, 29 CFR 1910.120. This may include emergency response following an earthquake. Instruction CPL 02-02-073 describes OSHA enforcement procedures under the relevant provisions of the HAZWOPER standard.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated a standard applying OSHA’s HAZWOPER standard to state and local government workers in states where there is no OSHA-approved State Plan. See 40 CFR Part 311.  OSHA’s HAZWOPER Safety and Health Topics page explains requirements of the OSHA HAZWOPER standard, including required worker training.

Pesticide contacts Report spills or environmental violations Managing debris Disasters can generate tons of debris, including building rubble, soil and sediments, green waste (e.g.., trees and shrubs), personal property, ash, and charred wood. How a community manages disaster debris depends on the debris generated and the waste management options available. Burying or burning is no longer acceptable, except when permission or a waiver has been granted, because of the side effects of smoke and fire from burning, and potential water and soil contamination from burial. Typical methods of recycling and solid waste disposal in sanitary landfills often cannot be applied to disaster debris because of the large volume of waste and reluctance to overburden existing disposal capacity.  Managing Debris After a Natural Disaster - a fact sheet  with guidelines to help make for a speedier removal process. General information on disaster debris - planning for and management of debris is an essential but often overlooked component of an emergency response or disaster incident. Renovation and rebuilding Lead-safe work: By law, contractors need to use lead-safe work practices on emergency renovations on homes or buildings built before 1978. Activities such as sanding, cutting, and demolition can create lead-based paint hazards. Lead-contaminated dust is harmful to adults, particularly pregnant women, and children.  Important information about post-disaster renovations and lead-based paint Ways to protect against lead-based paint hazards Asbestos: Anyone working on demolition, removal, and cleanup of building debris needs be aware of any asbestos and to handle asbestos materials properly. People exposed to asbestos dust can develop serious lung health problems including asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma. Although the use of asbestos has dramatically decreased in recent years, it is still found in many residential and commercial buildings and can pose a serious health risk.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/before.html	National	11/30/2022	English	Hurricane Warning, Tropical Storm Warning	Preparing for a Hurricane or Other Tropical Storm Hurricanes don’t only affect people living along the coast. They can cause damage hundreds of miles from the shore. Learn how to be prepared.  Make a Plan. Hurricane season starts on May 15 in the north Pacific and June 1 in the Atlantic and the Caribbean. It ends on November 30. Before hurricane season each year, make sure you and your family are prepared by planning ahead.  Write down emergency phone numbers and keep them on the refrigerator or near every phone in your house. Program them into your cell phone too. Prepare an emergency supply kit. Locate the nearest shelter and different routes you can take to get there from your home. If shelter locations in your area have not been identified, learn how to find them in the event of a storm. Pet owners: Pre-identify shelters, a pet-friendly hotel, or an out-of-town friend or relative where you can take your pets in an evacuation. Local animal shelters may be able to offer advice on what to do with your pets if you are asked to evacuate your home. Gather emergency supplies. During and after a hurricane, you may need supplies to keep your family safe and healthy. Remember that a hurricane could cut off your power and water supply. You also may not be able to drive because of damage to your car. Roads may be flooded or blocked.  That’s why it’s best to be prepared—stock up on everything you might need now. Be sure to prepare the following:  An emergency food and water supply. An emergency medicine supply. Emergency power sources such as flashlights (don’t forget extra batteries). Safety and personal items. Important documents, including medical documents, wills, passports, and personal identification. A fire extinguisher. Make sure your family knows where to find it and how to use it! Read the National Fire Protection Association’s tips for using fire extinguishers. Know the difference between a hurricane “watch” and “warning.” Listen for National Weather Service alerts on TV or radio or check for them online. There are two kinds of alerts:  A hurricane watch means hurricane conditions (sustained winds of 74 miles per hour [mph] or higher) are possible in a stated area. Experts announce hurricane watches 48 hours before they expect tropical-storm-force winds (sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph) to start. A hurricane warning is more serious. It means hurricane-force winds are expected in a stated area. Experts issue these warnings 36 hours before tropical-storm-force winds are expected in the area to give people enough time to prepare for the storm. For more information about hurricane watches and warnings, check out the National Weather Service’s Hurricane Center. If you hear that there is a hurricane watch or warning in your area, you can take steps to get ready.  Get your car ready. Make sure your car is ready before the storm hits.  Fill your car’s gas tank. Move cars and trucks into your garage or under cover. Always keep an emergency kit in your car. Visit Ready.gov for information on how to prepare your car and what to include in your kit. If you don’t own a car, consider making plans with friends or family or call authorities to get a ride if you need to evacuate.  Get your family and pets ready. Go over your emergency plan with your family. Keep checking for updates about the storm. Watch TV, listen to the radio, or check online. Call the hospital, public health department, or the police about special needs. If you or a loved one is older or disabled and won’t be able to leave quickly, get advice on what to do. Put pets and farm animals in a safe place. Read more about pet safety during an emergency. Get your home ready. Clear your yard. Make sure there’s nothing that could blow around during the storm and damage your home. Move bikes, lawn furniture, grills, propane tanks, and building material inside or under shelter. Cover up windows and doors. Use storm shutters or nail pieces of plywood to the outside window frames to protect your windows. This can help keep you safe from pieces of shattered glass. Be ready to turn off your power. If you see flooding, downed power lines, or you have to leave your home, switch your power off. Fill clean water containers with drinking water. You’ll want to do this in case you lose your water supply during the storm. You can also fill up your sinks and bathtubs with water for washing. Check your carbon monoxide (CO) detector’s battery to prevent CO poisoning Be ready to evacuate or stay at home. Always listen to authorities regarding whether you should evacuate or stay at home.  If a hurricane is coming, you may hear an order from authorities to evacuate (leave your home). Never ignore an order to evacuate. Even sturdy, well-built houses may not hold up against a hurricane. Staying home to protect your property is not worth risking your health and safety.  You may hear an order to stay at home. If driving conditions are dangerous, staying at home might be safer than leaving.  If you need to evacuate:  Grab your emergency supply kit and only take what you really need with you (cell phone, chargers, medicines, identification like a passport or license, and cash). Unplug your appliances. If you have time, turn off the gas, electricity, and water. Follow the roads that emergency workers recommend even if there’s traffic. Other routes might be blocked or flooded. Never drive through flooded areas—cars and other vehicles can be swept away or may stall in just 6 inches of moving water. Contact your local emergency management office and ask if they offer accommodations for owners and their pets. Learn more about evacuating with your pet. If you need to stay home:  Keep your emergency supply kit in a place you can easily access. Listen to the radio or TV for updates on the hurricane. Stay inside. Even if it looks calm, don’t go outside. Wait until you hear or see an official message that the hurricane is over. Sometimes, weather gets calm in the middle of a storm but then quickly gets bad again. Stay away from windows—you could get hurt by pieces of broken glass or flying debris during a storm. Stay in a room with no windows, or go inside a closet. Be ready to leave. If emergency authorities order you to leave or if your home is damaged, you may need to go to a shelter or a neighbor’s house.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	https://www.cdc.gov/es/disasters/hurricanes/before.html	National	11/30/2022	Spanish	Hurricane Warning, Tropical Storm Warning	Cómo prepararse para un huracán u otra tormenta tropical Los huracanes no solo afectan a las personas que viven en la costa. También pueden causar daño a cientos de millas de la costa. Sepa cómo estar preparado.  Haga un plan. La temporada de huracanes comienza el 15 de mayo en el área norte del Pacífico y el 1 de junio en el Atlántico y el Caribe. Termina el 30 de noviembre. Antes de que comience la temporada de huracanes cada año, asegúrese de que usted y su familia estén preparados al planificar con suficiente tiempo.  Anote los números de teléfono de emergencia y téngalos pegados en el refrigerador o cerca de cada teléfono de la casa. Téngalos programados también en su celular. Prepare un kit de suministros de emergencia. Ubique el refugio más cercano y las diferentes rutas que puede tomar para llegar desde su casa. Si no se han identificado los sitios de refugio para su área, averigüe cómo encontrarlos en caso de que haya una tormenta. Dueños de mascotas: Identifique de antemano un refugio o un hotel que acepte animales, o un amigo o familiar en otra ciudad al que le pueda llevar sus mascotas en caso de evacuación. Los refugios locales para animales quizás puedan aconsejarle qué hacer con sus mascotas si se le pide evacuar su casa. Reúna suministros de emergencia. Durante y después de un huracán, podría necesitar suministros para mantener a su familia sana y salva. Recuerde que un huracán puede interrumpir el suministro de agua y electricidad. Además, es posible que la tormenta dañe su auto y no lo pueda usar. Las calles podrían estar inundadas o bloqueadas.  Por eso es mejor estar preparado: provéase ahora de todo lo que podría necesitar. Asegúrese de preparar lo siguiente:  Una reserva de alimentos y agua de emergencia. Una reserva de medicamentos de emergencia. Fuentes de energía de emergencia, como linternas (no se olvide de tener pilas adicionales). Artículos de seguridad y personales. Documentos importantes, incluidos documentos médicos, testamentos, pasaportes y de identificación personal. Un extintor de incendios. ¡Asegúrese de que su familia sepa dónde encontrarlo y cómo usarlo! Lea los consejos de cómo usar los extintores de incendios de la Asociación Nacional de Protección contra Incendios. Conozca la diferencia entre una alerta de vigilancia (watch) y un aviso (warning) de huracán. Esté atento a las alertas que el Servicio Nacional de Meteorología emita por televisión o radio, o busque la información en Internet. Hay dos tipos de alerta:  Las alertas de vigilancia de huracán indican que es posible que se presenten condiciones huracanadas (vientos sostenidos de 74 millas por hora [mph] o mayores) en un área determinada. Los expertos anuncian las alertas de vigilancia de huracán 48 horas antes de que se esperen vientos con fuerza de tormenta tropical (vientos sostenidos de 39 a 73 mph). Los avisos de huracán son más serios. Significan que se esperan vientos con fuerza de huracán en un área determinada. Los expertos los anuncian 36 horas antes de que se esperen estos vientos en el área a fin de dar a las personas suficiente tiempo para prepararse para la tormenta. Para obtener más información sobre las alertas de vigilancia y los avisos de huracán, consulte el sitio web del Centro de Huracanes del Servicio Nacional de Meteorología. Si se entera de que hay una alerta de vigilancia o un aviso de huracán en su zona, puede tomar medidas para prepararse.  Prepare el auto. Asegúrese de que su auto esté listo antes de que llegue la tormenta.  Llene el tanque de gasolina. Guarde los autos y las camionetas dentro del garaje o bajo techo. Tenga siempre un kit para emergencias en el auto. Visite Ready.gov para obtener información sobre cómo preparar el auto y qué incluir en el kit. Si no tiene auto, considere hacer planes con amigos o familiares, o llamar a las autoridades para que lo pasen a buscar en caso de que sea necesario evacuar el área.  Prepare a su familia y a sus mascotas. Repase su plan de emergencia con su familia. Revise continuamente si hay información actualizada sobre la tormenta. Vea la televisión, escuche la radio o busque la información en línea. Llame al hospital, al departamento de salud pública o a la policía si tiene necesidades que requieran atención especial. Si usted o uno de sus seres queridos es mayor o tiene una discapacidad y no podrá irse rápidamente, busque consejo sobre qué hacer. Ponga las mascotas y los animales de granja en un lugar seguro. Obtenga más información sobre la seguridad de las mascotas durante una emergencia. Prepare su casa. Despeje el jardín. Asegúrese de que no haya nada que pueda salir volando durante la tormenta y dañar la casa. Guarde las bicicletas, los muebles de jardín, las parrillas, los tanques de propano y el material de construcción adentro o en un lugar resguardado. Cubra las puertas y ventanas. Cierre las persianas contra tormentas o clave planchas de madera contrachapada (plywood) sobre los marcos exteriores de las ventanas para protegerlas. Esto puede ayudar a protegerlo para que no se lastime con pedazos de vidrio roto. Esté preparado para cortar la electricidad. Si se inunda su casa, ve cables del tendido eléctrico caídos o se debe ir de su casa, corte la electricidad. Llene recipientes limpios para agua con agua para beber. Se recomienda que lo haga por si se corta el agua durante la tormenta. También puede llenar los lavamanos o fregaderos y las bañeras con agua para lavar. Revise la batería de los detectores de monóxido de carbono (CO) para prevenir las intoxicaciones por monóxido de carbono. Esté preparado para evacuar o permanecer en su casa. Escuche siempre a las autoridades sobre si debe evacuar o permanecer en su casa.  Si viene un huracán, es posible que reciba la orden de evacuar (irse de su casa). No ignore nunca una orden de evacuación. Las casas, incluso las sólidas y bien construidas, podrían no resistir la fuerza de un huracán. No vale la pena quedarse, y arriesgar su salud y seguridad para proteger su propiedad.  También es posible que le den la orden de quedarse en casa. Si las condiciones son peligrosas para manejar, quedarse en casa podría ser más seguro que irse.  Si debe evacuar su casa:  Lleve su kit de suministros de emergencia y solo lo que realmente necesite, como su teléfono celular, cargador, documento de identidad (p. ej., pasaporte o licencia de conducir), sus medicamentos y dinero en efectivo. Desenchufe los electrodomésticos. Si tiene tiempo, corte el gas, la electricidad y el agua. Siga las rutas que los trabajadores de emergencias recomienden, aunque haya tráfico. Las otras rutas podrían estar bloqueadas o inundadas. No conduzca nunca por un área inundada: las corrientes de agua de tan solo 6 pulgadas de profundidad tienen la capacidad de detener o arrastrar autos y otros vehículos. Comuníquese con la oficina local de manejo de emergencias y pregunte si tienen lugares de refugio para personas con mascotas. Infórmese más sobre cómo evacuar su casa con su mascota. Si necesita quedarse en su casa:  Mantenga su kit de suministros de emergencia en un lugar de fácil acceso. Escuche la radio o vea la televisión para mantenerse informado sobre el huracán. Quédese adentro. Aunque se vea tranquilo, no vaya afuera. Espere hasta que escuche o vea un mensaje oficial que diga que el huracán ha pasado. A veces, el tiempo se calma en el medio de la tormenta, pero vuelve a ponerse severo rápidamente. Manténgase alejado de las ventanas para evitar lastimarse con los pedazos de vidrio roto o escombros que el viento levante durante la tormenta. Quédese en una habitación que no tenga ventanas, o métase dentro de un clóset. Esté preparado para irse. Si las autoridades de emergencia le ordenan que se vaya o si se daña su casa, es posible que deba ir a un refugio o a la casa de un vecino.

National	NA	English	Landslide	Landslide Preparedness  Landslide and debris flow warning signs, what to do before, during, and after.   Landslide Warning Signs Springs, seeps, or saturated ground in areas that have not typically been wet before. New cracks or unusual bulges in the ground, street pavements or sidewalks. Soil moving away from foundations. Ancillary structures such as decks and patios tilting and/or moving relative to the main house. Tilting or cracking of concrete floors and foundations. Broken water lines and other underground utilities. Leaning telephone poles, trees, retaining walls or fences. Offset fence lines. Sunken or down-dropped road beds. Rapid increase in creek water levels, possibly accompanied by increased turbidity (soil content). Sudden decrease in creek water levels though rain is still falling or just recently stopped. Sticking doors and windows, and visible open spaces indicating jambs and frames out of plumb. A faint rumbling sound that increases in volume is noticeable as the landslide nears. Unusual sounds, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together, might indicate moving debris. road at base of steep slope next to river, and rocks covering the road at one point Sources/Usage: Some content may have restrictions. Visit Media to see details. Rockslide on California State Route 70 in the Feather River Canyon, Butte/Plumas county line, northern California. This slide was triggered on October 24, 2021 by a Category 5 atmospheric river, which released more than ten inches of rain in the area over a 48-hour period. Approximately seven thousand cubic yards of rock and debris buried and closed the highway. Areas that are generally prone to landslide hazards On existing old landslides. On or at the base of slopes. In or at the base of minor drainage hollows. At the base or top of an old fill slope. At the base or top of a steep cut slope. Developed hillsides where leach field septic systems are used. Areas that are typically considered safe from landslides On hard, non-jointed bedrock that has not moved in the past. On relatively flat-lying areas away from sudden changes in slope angle. At the top or along the nose of ridges, set back from the tops of slopes. What To Do Before a Landslide Do not build near steep slopes, close to mountain edges, near drainage ways, or natural erosion valleys. Get a ground assessment of your property. Contact local officials, state geological surveys or departments of natural resources, and university departments of geology. Landslides occur where they have before, and in identifiable hazard locations. Ask for information on landslides in your area, specific information on areas vulnerable to landslides, and request a professional referral for a very detailed site analysis of your property, and corrective measures you can take, if necessary. Watch the patterns of storm-water drainage near your home, and note the places where runoff water converges, increasing flow in channels. These are areas to avoid during a storm. Learn about the emergency-response and evacuation plans for your area. Develop your own emergency plan for your family or business. Minimize home hazards: Have flexible pipe fittings installed to avoid gas or water leaks, as flexible fittings are more resistant to breakage (only the gas company or professionals should install gas fittings). Plant ground cover on slopes and build retaining walls. In mudflow areas, build channels or deflection walls to direct the flow around buildings. Remember: If you build walls to divert debris flow and the flow lands on a neighbor's property, you may be liable for damages. What To Do During a Landslide Stay alert and awake. Many debris-flow fatalities occur when people are sleeping. Listen to a NOAA Weather Radio or portable, battery-powered radio or television for warnings of intense rainfall. Be aware that intense, short bursts of rain may be particularly dangerous, especially after longer periods of heavy rainfall and damp weather. If you are in areas susceptible to landslides and debris flows, consider leaving if it is safe to do so. Remember that driving during an intense storm can be hazardous. If you remain at home, move to a second story if possible. Staying out of the path of a landslide or debris flow saves lives. Listen for any unusual sounds that might indicate moving debris, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together. A trickle of flowing or falling mud or debris may precede larger landslides. Moving debris can flow quickly and sometimes without warning. If you are near a stream or channel, be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow and for a change from clear to muddy water. Such changes may indicate landslide activity upstream, so be prepared to move quickly. Don't delay! Save yourself, not your belongings. Be especially alert when driving. Bridges may be washed out, and culverts overtopped. Do not cross flooding streams!! Turn Around, Don't Drown®!. Embankments along roadsides are particularly susceptible to landslides. Watch the road for collapsed pavement, mud, fallen rocks, and other indications of possible debris flows. Be aware that strong shaking from earthquakes can induce or intensify the effects of landslides. What to Do if You Suspect Imminent Landslide Danger Contact your local fire, police, or public works department. Local officials are the best persons able to assess potential danger. Inform affected neighbors. Your neighbors may not be aware of potential hazards. Advising them of a potential threat may help save lives. Help neighbors who may need assistance to evacuate. Evacuate. Getting out of the path of a landslide or debris flow is your best protection. Curl into a tight ball and protect your head if escape is not possible. What To Do After a Landslide Stay away from the slide area. There may be danger of additional slides. Listen to local radio or television stations for the latest emergency information. Watch for flooding, which may occur after a landslide or debris flow. Floods sometimes follow landslides and debris flows because they may both be started by the same event. Check for injured and trapped persons near the slide, without entering the direct slide area. Direct rescuers to their locations. Help a neighbor who may require special assistance - infants, elderly people, and people with disabilities. Elderly people and people with disabilities may require additional assistance. People who care for them or who have large families may need additional assistance in emergency situations. Look for and report broken utility lines and damaged roadways and railways to appropriate authorities. Reporting potential hazards will get the utilities turned off as quickly as possible, preventing further hazard and injury. Check the building foundation, chimney, and surrounding land for damage. Damage to foundations, chimneys, or surrounding land may help you assess the safety of the area. Replant damaged ground as soon as possible since erosion caused by loss of ground cover can lead to flash flooding and additional landslides in the near future. Seek advice from a geotechnical expert for evaluating landslide hazards or designing corrective techniques to reduce landslide risk. A professional will be able to advise you of the best ways to prevent or reduce landslide risk, without creating further hazard.

The term landslide describes downhill earth movements that can move slowly and cause damage gradually, or move rapidly, destroying property and taking lives suddenly and unexpectedly. Most landslides are caused by natural forces or events, such as heavy rain and snowmelt, shaking due to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and gravity. Landslides are typically associated with periods of heavy rainfall or rapid snowmelt and tend to worsen the effects of flooding. Areas burned by forest and brush fires are also particularly susceptible to landslides.  Landslides generally happen in areas where they have occurred in the past. Learn about your area’s landslide risk. Landslides can also be referred to as mudslides, debris flows, mudflows or debris avalanches.  Debris flows and other landslides onto roadways are common during rainstorms.  Heavily saturated ground is very susceptible to mudflows and debris flows.  Be aware that, generally, landslide insurance is not available, but that debris flow damage may be covered by flood insurance policies from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) at www.FloodSmart.gov  What Should You Do Before a Landslide Play Video Prepare in Advance Be sure you're Red Cross Ready.

If you suspect imminent danger, evacuate immediately. Inform affected neighbors if you can, and contact your public works, fire or police department. Listen for unusual sounds that might indicate moving debris, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together. If you are near a stream or channel, be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow and notice whether the water changes from clear to muddy. Such changes may mean there is debris flow activity upstream so be prepared to move quickly. Be especially alert when driving— watch for collapsed pavement, mud, fallen rocks and other indications of possible debris flow. If you are ordered or decide to evacuate, take your animals with you. Consider a precautionary evacuation of large or numerous animals as soon as you are aware of impending danger.    During Severe Storms   Stay alert and awake. Many deaths from landslides occur while people are sleeping. Listen to local news stations on a battery-powered radio for warnings of heavy rainfall. Consider leaving if it is safe to do so. What Should You Do After a Landslide What should I do after a landslide or mudslide?   Stay away from the slide area. There may be danger of additional slides. Check for injured and trapped persons near the slide, without entering the direct slide area. Direct rescuers to their locations. Help a neighbor who may require special assistance--infants, elderly people, and people with disabilities. Elderly people and people with disabilities may require additional assistance. People who care for them or who have large families may need additional assistance in emergency situations. Listen to local radio or television stations for the latest emergency information. Watch for flooding, which may occur after a landslide or debris flow. Floods sometimes follow landslides and debris flows because they may both be started by the same event. Look for and report broken utility lines to appropriate authorities. Reporting potential hazards will get the utilities turned off as quickly as possible, preventing further hazard and injury. Check the building foundation, chimney, and surrounding land for damage. Damage to foundations, chimneys, or surrounding land may help you assess the safety of the area. Replant damaged ground as soon as possible since erosion caused by loss of ground cover can lead to flash flooding. Seek the advice of a geotechnical expert for evaluating landslide hazards or designing corrective techniques to reduce landslide risk. A professional will be able to advise you of the best ways to prevent or reduce landslide risk, without creating further hazard.

The most dangerous, life-threatening and deadliest landslides are the ones that occur quickly, often with little notice.  feature_mini img A landslide occurs when masses of rock, mud or debris move down a slope. When a wildfire burns a slope, it increases the chance of landslides for several years.  How to protect yourself or your property depends on the type of landslide. Land-use zoning, professional inspections, and proper design can reduce many landslide problems, but evacuation often is the only way to protect lives from a debris flow or other fast-moving landslide.  Not all landslides are fast. Some slow-moving landslides move at a snail’s pace, stopping and starting, and not advancing more than three feet a year. While these landslides rarely cause loss of life, they can cause damage to land and property over time.  Before a Landslide The following are things you can do to protect yourself, your family and your property from the effects of a landslide or debris flow:  Image An emergency supply kit that includes scissors, duct tape, plastic a flashlight and cleaning supplies.  Build an emergency kit. Make a plan for your household, including your pets, so that you and your family know what to do and where to go in the event of a landslide. Sign up for your community’s warning system. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio also provide emergency alerts. Leave if you have been told to evacuate or you feel it is unsafe to remain in your home. Text SHELTER + your ZIP code to 43362 (4FEMA) to find the nearest shelter in your area (example: shelter 12345). Consult a professional for advice on appropriate preventative measures for your home or business, such as flexible pipe fittings, which can resist breakage better. Protect your property based on recommendations from a qualified geotechnical professional and/or local city/county guidance on protection from debris flow and flooding. You can't stop or change the path of a debris flow. However, you may be able to protect your property from floodwaters or mud by use of sandbags, retaining walls or k-rails (Jersey barriers). In mud and debris flow areas, consider building channels or deflection walls to try to direct the flow around buildings. Be aware, however, that when a flow is big enough, it goes where it pleases. Also, you may be liable for damages if you divert a flow and it flows on a neighbor's property. Talk to your insurance agent if you are at risk from a landslide. Debris flow may be covered by flood insurance policies from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Recognize Warning Signs Watch for debris flows and other fast-moving landslides that pose threats to life:  If you are near a wildfire burn area, sign up for emergency alerts and pay attention to weather forecasts for the burn area. Listen and watch for rushing water, mud or unusual sounds. Unusual sounds such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together, might indicate moving debris. A faint rumbling sound that increases in volume is noticeable as the landslide nears. Huge boulders in the landscape can be signs of past debris flows. Watch for slow-moving landslides, or earthflows, that pose threats to property:  Changes occur in your landscape such as patterns of storm-water drainage on slopes (especially the places where runoff water converges) land movement, small slides, flows, or progressively leaning trees. Doors or windows stick or jam for the first time. New cracks appear in plaster, tile, brick or foundations. Outside walls, walkways or stairs begin pulling away from the building. Slowly developing, widening cracks appear on the ground or on paved areas such as streets or driveways. Underground utility lines break. Bulging ground appears at the base of a slope. Water breaks through the ground surface in new locations. Fences, retaining walls, utility poles, or trees tilt or move. The ground slopes downward in one direction and may begin shifting in that direction under your feet. During a Landslide Image A woman listing to the radio Listen to local news stations on a battery-powered radio for warnings. Always follow the instructions from local emergency managers. They provide the latest recommendations based on the threat in your community. Stay alert and awake during a storm that could cause a landslide. Many deaths from landslides occur while people are sleeping. Be aware that by the time you are sure a debris flow is coming, it will be too late to get away safely. Never cross a road with water or mud flowing. Never cross a bridge if you see a flow approaching because it can grow faster and larger too quickly for you to escape. If you do get stuck in the path of a landslide move uphill as quickly as possible. Avoid river valleys and low-lying areas during times of danger. If you are near a stream or channel, be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow or water that changes from clear to muddy. These can be signs that a landslide is coming. After a Landslide Stay away from the slide area. There may be danger coming from additional slides. Listen to local radio or television stations for the latest emergency information. Watch for flooding. Floods sometimes follow landslides and debris flows because they may both be started by the same conditions. Check for injured and trapped persons near the slide, without entering the direct slide area. Direct rescuers to their locations. Report broken utility lines and damaged roadways and railways to appropriate authorities. Reporting potential hazards will get the utilities turned off as quickly as possible, preventing further hazard and injury. Allow trained professionals to check the building foundation, chimney, and surrounding land for damage. Replant damaged ground as soon as possible since erosion caused by loss of ground cover can lead to flash flooding and additional landslides in the near future. Seek advice from a geotechnical expert for evaluating landslide hazards or designing corrective techniques to reduce landslide risk. A professional can advise you of the best ways to prevent or reduce landslide risk, without creating further hazard.

ready.gov	https://www.ready.gov/es/deslizamientos-de-tierra-y-avalanchas	National	2/3/2023	Spanish	Landslide	Deslizamientos de tierra y avalanchas de escombros Antes de un deslizamiento de tierra    Durante un deslizamiento de tierra    Después de un deslizamiento de tierra    Contenido relacionado  Los deslizamientos de tierra ocurren en todos los estados y territorios de los EE. UU. y pueden ser causados por varios factores, incluyendo los terremotos, tormentas, erupciones volcánicas, incendios y modificaciones de la tierra por parte del ser humano. Los deslizamientos de tierra más peligrosos y mortales son los que ocurren rápidamente, muchas veces con poco aviso.  feature_mini img Un deslizamiento de tierra ocurre cuando masas de roca, lodo o escombros descienden por una pendiente. Cuando un incendio forestal quema una pendiente, esto aumenta la probabilidad de que ocurran deslizamientos de tierra durante varios años.  Cómo debe protegerse a sí mismo o su propiedad depende del tipo de deslizamiento de tierra. La zonificación del uso de terrenos, las inspecciones profesionales y el diseño adecuado pueden reducir muchos de los problemas de deslizamientos de tierra, pero el desalojo es frecuentemente la única manera de proteger las vidas contra avalanchas de escombros u otros deslizamientos rápidos de tierra.  No todos los deslizamientos de tierra son rápidos. Algunos deslizamientos de tierra lentos se mueven a paso de tortuga, se detienen y vuelven a empezar, y no avanzan más de tres pies por año. Aunque estos deslizamientos de tierra pocas veces causan pérdidas de vidas humanas, pueden causar daños al terreno y la propiedad con el tiempo.  Antes de un deslizamiento de tierra A continuación, se indican las cosas que usted puede hacer para protegerse a sí mismo, su familia y su propiedad contra los efectos de un deslizamiento de tierra o avalancha de escombros:  Image An emergency supply kit that includes scissors, duct tape, plastic a flashlight and cleaning supplies.  Prepare un kit de suministros de emergencia. Haga un plan para su familia, incluyendo sus mascotas, para que sepan qué hacer y adónde ir si ocurre un deslizamiento de tierra. Inscríbase en el sistema de avisos de su comunidad. El Sistema de Alerta por Emergencia (EAS, por sus siglas en inglés) y la Radio Meteorológica de la Administración Nacional Oceánica y Atmosférica (NOAA, por sus siglas en inglés) también emiten alertas por emergencias. Debe irse si le han dicho que desaloje o si cree que no es seguro permanecer en su casa. Envíe REFUGIO + su código postal por mensaje de texto al 43362 (4FEMA) para encontrar el refugio más cercano en su zona (ejemplo: refugio 12345). Consulte con un profesional para obtener consejos sobre las medidas preventivas adecuadas para su hogar o negocio, como juntas de tubería flexible, las cuales pueden resistir mejor contra las roturas. Proteja su propiedad según las recomendaciones de un profesional geotécnico cualificado y/o las guías locales de su ciudad o condado sobre la protección contra avalanchas de escombros e inundaciones. No se puede detener o cambiar la trayectoria de una avalancha de escombros. Sin embargo, podría proteger su propiedad contra las aguas de inundación o el lodo con bolsas de arena, muros de contención o barreras de Jersey (rieles-k). En zonas donde hay avalanchas de lodo y escombros, considere la posibilidad de construir canales o muros de desviación para intentar desviar la avalancha de manera que pase por los lados de los edificios. Sin embargo, debe tener en cuenta que, cuando la avalancha esté lo suficientemente grande, va donde quiera. También, usted podría ser responsable de los daños si desvía una avalancha y fluye sobre la propiedad de su vecino. Hable con su agente de seguros para verificar si usted está en riesgo por deslizamientos de tierra. Daños por avalanchas de escombros podrían estar cubiertos por las pólizas del seguro de inundación del Programa del Seguro Nacional de Inundación (NFIP, por sus siglas en inglés). Reconozca los signos de advertencia Debe estar atento a avalanchas de escombros y otros deslizamientos de tierra rápidos que representan amenazas contra la vida:  Si se encuentra cerca de una zona de quema de un incendio forestal, suscríbase a las alertas de emergencia y preste atención a las previsiones meteorológicas para la zona de quema. Esté atento y vigile para torrentes de agua, lodo o sonidos raros. Sonidos raros, como el crujido de árboles o rocas que se chocan, podrían indicar el movimiento de escombros. Cuando se acerca un deslizamiento de tierra, se nota un rugido leve distante cuyo volumen se aumenta. Rocas enormes en el paisaje podrían ser signos de avalanchas de escombros pasados. Vigile para deslizamientos de tierra lentos, o avalanchas de tierra, que representan amenazas para la propiedad:  Cambios ocurren en su paisaje, como patrones de drenaje de agua de lluvia en las pendientes (en especial en los lugares donde se convergen el agua de lluvia), movimiento de la tierra, deslizamientos menores, flujos o árboles que se inclinan progresivamente. Puertas o ventanas se atascan o se traban por primera vez. Nuevas fisuras aparecen en el yeso, las baldosas, los ladrillos o los cimientos. Paredes exteriores, pasadizos y escaleras empiezan a separarse del edificio. Grietas que se desarrollan y amplían lentamente en el suelo o en áreas pavimentadas, como en las calles o las entradas. Se rompen las líneas de servicios públicos subterráneas. Aparecen bultos en la tierra en la base de una pendiente. El agua sale de la superficie del suelo en lugares nuevos. Cercas, muros de contención, postes eléctricos o árboles se inclinan o mueven. La tierra se inclina hacia abajo en una dirección y podría empezar a desplazarse en la misma dirección debajo de sus pies. Durante un deslizamiento de tierra Image A woman listing to the radio Escuche las noticias de emisoras locales en una radio que opere con baterías para enterarse de los avisos. Siga siempre las instrucciones de las autoridades locales de manejo de emergencias. Éstos proveen las recomendaciones más actualizadas según la amenaza en su comunidad. Manténgase alerta y despierto durante una tormenta que podría causar un deslizamiento de tierra. Muchas de las muertes por deslizamientos de tierra ocurren cuando las personas están dormidas. Tenga en cuenta que, antes de estar seguro de que viene una avalancha de escombros, ya será muy tarde para huir de manera segura. Nunca cruce una calle donde hay flujos de agua o lodo. Nunca cruce un puente si puede ver que se acerca una avalancha, ya que puede aumentar de velocidad y tamaño muy rápidamente sin permitirle tiempo para huir. Si se queda atrapado en la trayectoria de un deslizamiento de tierra suba por una cuesta lo más rápido posible. Evite valles de ríos o áreas bajas durante momentos de peligro. Si se encuentra cerca de un arroyo o canal, esté alerta para cualquier aumento o decrecimiento repentino en el flujo del agua, o agua clara que se vuelve lodosa. Estos podrían ser signos de que se acerca un deslizamiento de tierra. Después de un deslizamiento de tierra Manténgase alejado de la zona del deslizamiento. Podría haber peligro por deslizamientos adicionales. Escuche las emisoras de radio y televisión para enterarse de la información más actualizada sobre la emergencia. Esté atento a posibles inundaciones. Las inundaciones a veces ocurren tras los deslizamientos de tierra y avalanchas de escombros, porque las mismas condiciones pueden causarlas. Busque personas heridas o atrapadas cerca del deslizamiento, sin entrar en la zona directa del deslizamiento. Dirija a los rescatistas a los lugares donde estas personas se encuentran. Informe a las autoridades correspondientes sobre líneas de servicios públicos rotas y carreteras y vías de ferrocarriles dañados. Informar sobre posibles riesgos hará que se interrumpan los servicios públicos tan pronto como sea posible para evitar más riesgos y lesiones. Permita que los profesionales capacitados inspeccionen los cimientos del edificio, la chimenea y el terreno alrededor para detectar daños. Vuelva a sembrar la tierra dañada de inmediato, ya que la erosión por pérdida de la capa vegetal podría ocasionar inundaciones repentinas y más deslizamientos de tierra en el futuro cercano. Solicite consejos de un experto geotécnico para evaluar los riesgos de deslizamiento de tierra o para diseñar técnicas correctivas para reducir el riesgo de deslizamiento de tierra. Un profesional puede aconsejarle sobre las mejores maneras de evitar o reducir el riesgo de deslizamientos de tierra, sin causar más peligro.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/landslides.html	National	1/12/2018	English	Landslide	Landslides and Mudslides FACT SHEET  What landslides and debris flows are Rocks Falling from Cliff Landslides occur when masses of rock, earth, or debris move down a slope. Debris flows, also known as mudslides, are a common type of fast-moving landslide that tends to flow in channels.  What causes landslides and debris flows Large Muddy Area on Road Landslides are caused by disturbances in the natural stability of a slope. They can accompany heavy rains or follow droughts, earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions. Mudslides develop when water rapidly accumulates in the ground and results in a surge of water-saturated rock, earth, and debris. Mudslides usually start on steep slopes and can be activated by natural disasters. Areas where wildfires or human modification of the land have destroyed vegetation on slopes are particularly vulnerable to landslides during and after heavy rains.  On This Page What causes landslides and debris flows Health threats from landslides and debris flows What areas are at risk What you can do to protect yourself Additional information on landslide and mudflow hazards Health threats from landslides and debris flows In the United States, landslides and debris flows result in 25 to 50 deaths each year. The health hazards associated with landslides and mudflows include:  Rapidly moving water and debris that can lead to trauma; Broken electrical, water, gas, and sewage lines that can result in injury or illness; and Disrupted roadways and railways that can endanger motorists and disrupt transport and access to health care. What areas are at risk Some areas are more likely to experience landslides or mudflows, including:  Areas where wildfires or human modification of the land have destroyed vegetation; Areas where landslides have occurred before; Steep slopes and areas at the bottom of slopes or canyons; Slopes that have been altered for construction of buildings and roads; Channels along a stream or river; and Areas where surface runoff is directed. Top of Page What you can do to protect yourself Before intense storms and rainfall A picture of an area burned by wildfire which is vulnerable to landslides and debris flows Assume that steep slopes and areas burned by wildfires are vulnerable to landslides and debris flows. Learn whether landslides or debris flows have occurred previously in your area by contacting local authorities, a county geologist or the county planning department, state geological surveys or departments of natural resources, or university departments of geology. Contact local authorities about emergency and evacuation plans. Develop emergency and evacuation plans for your family and business. Develop an emergency communication plan in case family members are separated. If you live in an area vulnerable to landslides, consider leaving it. During intense storms and rainfall Listen to the radio or watch TV for warnings about intense rainfall or for information and instructions from local officials. Be aware of any sudden increase or decrease in water level on a stream or creek that might indicate debris flow upstream. A trickle of flowing mud may precede a larger flow. Look for tilted trees, telephone poles, fences, or walls, and for new holes or bare spots on hillsides. Listen for rumbling sounds that might indicate an approaching landslide or mudflow. Be alert when driving. Roads may become blocked or closed due to collapsed pavement or debris. If landslide or debris flow danger is imminent, quickly move away from the path of the slide. Getting out of the path of a debris flow is your best protection. Move to the nearest high ground in a direction away from the path. If rocks and debris are approaching, run for the nearest shelter and take cover (if possible, under a desk, table, or other piece of sturdy furniture). After a landslide or debris flow Photo of a flooded neighborhood. Stay away from the site. Flooding or additional slides may occur after a landslide or mudflow. Check for injured or trapped people near the affected area, if it is possible to do so without entering the path of the landslide or mudflow. Listen to the radio or TV for emergency information. Report broken utility lines to the appropriate authorities. Consult a geotechnical expert (a registered professional engineer with soils engineering expertise) for advice on reducing additional landslide problems and risks. Local authorities should be able to tell you how to contact a geotechnical expert.

Los aludes de barro, también conocidos como flujos de lodo o deslizamientos de barro, son un tipo común de deslizamiento de tierra a gran velocidad que tiende a desplazarse formando canales.  Qué causa los deslizamientos de tierra y los aludes de barro Gran área llena de lodo en un camino Los deslizamientos de tierra son causados por alteraciones en el equilibrio natural de una pendiente. Pueden ocurrir durante lluvias torrenciales o producirse luego de sequías, terremotos o erupciones volcánicas. Los aludes de barro se producen cuando el agua se acumula rápidamente en la tierra y causa un repentino aumento de rocas, tierra y detritos saturados con agua. Por lo general, los aludes de barro comienzan en pendientes empinadas y pueden ser desencadenados por desastres naturales. Las áreas empinadas en las que los incendios forestales o cambios en el terreno hechos por el hombre han destruido la vegetación son particularmente propensas a los deslizamientos de tierra durante y después de lluvias  Inicio de la página Qué causa los deslizamientos de tierra y los aludes de barro Los riesgos para la salud que presentan los deslizamientos de tierra y los aludes de barro Qué áreas están en riesgo Qué puede hacer para protegerse Información Adicional Los riesgos para la salud que presentan los deslizamientos de tierra y los aludes de barro En los Estados Unidos, los deslizamientos de tierra y los aludes de barro causan entre 25 y 50 muertes cada año. Los riesgos para la salud asociados a los deslizamientos de tierra y los aludes de barro incluyen los siguientes:  Corrientes rápidas de agua o detritos que pueden provocar traumatismos. Cables eléctricos, cañerías de agua o gas y alcantarillas averiadas que pueden causar lesiones o enfermedades. Carreteras y vías férreas cortadas que pueden poner en peligro a los automovilistas y afectar el transporte y acceso a la atención médica. Qué áreas están en riesgo Algunas áreas son más propensas a los deslizamientos de tierra o aludes de barro como, por ejemplo, las siguientes:  Áreas donde los incendios forestales o los cambios en el terreno hechos por el hombre han destruido la vegetación. Zonas donde ya han ocurrido deslizamientos de tierra. Pendientes empinadas y áreas ubicadas en la falda de las laderas o los barrancos. Laderas que han sido alteradas por la construcción de edificios y caminos. Canales a lo largo de riachuelos o ríos. Áreas hacia las que se dirigen las aguas de escorrentía. Inicio de la página Qué puede hacer para protegerse Antes de las tormentas y lluvias fuertes Foto de árboles quemados Dé por sentado que las pendientes empinadas y las áreas quemadas por los incendios forestales son propensas a los deslizamientos de tierra y a los aludes de barro.  Averigüe si ya han ocurrido deslizamientos de tierra o aludes de barro en su área. Para eso comuníquese con las autoridades locales, un geólogo del condado o el departamento de planificación del condado, el servicio geológico o el departamento de recursos naturales del estado, o los departamentos de geología de las universidades. Comuníquese con las autoridades locales para averiguar los planes de emergencia y evacuación. Elabore un plan de emergencia y evacuación para su familia y su negocio. Elabore un plan de comunicación de emergencia en caso de que los miembros de su familia queden separados. Si vive en un área propensa a los deslizamientos de tierra, considere abandonar el lugar. Durante las tormentas y lluvias fuertes Escuche la radio o vea la televisión para enterarse de las advertencias de lluvias intensas o para obtener información e instrucciones de las autoridades locales. Manténgase atento para ver si se producen repentinos aumentos o disminuciones en los niveles de agua de los riachuelos o arroyos ya que podrían indicar la existencia de un alud de barro corriente arriba. Una corriente fina de barro puede preceder a una corriente más grande. Fíjese en si se han inclinado los árboles, postes de teléfono, cercas o paredes, así como si aparecen huecos o partes descubiertas en las laderas. Esté pendiente de estruendos que podrían indicar que se aproxima un deslizamiento de tierra o un alud de barro. Esté atento al manejar. Los caminos pueden quedar bloqueados o cerrados si hay pavimento hundido o detritos. Si el peligro de que se produzca un deslizamiento de tierra o un alud de barro es inminente, salga rápidamente de su paso. La mejor protección es salir del paso del alud de barro. Diríjase al terreno elevado más cercano, pero lejos del paso del alud. Si observa que se acercan rocas o detritos, corra hacia el refugio más cercano y protéjase (si es posible, debajo de un escritorio, una mesa o cualquier mueble sólido). Después de un deslizamiento de tierra o alud de barro Foto de un vecindario inundado Manténgase alejado del lugar. Después de un deslizamiento de tierra o alud de barro pueden ocurrir inundaciones o más deslizamientos.  Revise si en la zona afectada hay personas heridas o atrapadas, siempre y cuando lo pueda hacer sin ingresar al paso del deslizamiento de tierra o alud de barro. Escuche la radio o la televisión para recibir información de emergencia. Avíseles a las autoridades correspondientes si encuentra cables del tendido eléctrico o de teléfono rotos. Consulte a un experto en geotecnia (un ingeniero titulado especializado en suelos) para que le dé consejos sobre cómo disminuir otros riesgos y problemas relacionados con los deslizamientos de tierra. Las autoridades locales deberían poder decirle cómo contactar a un experto en geotecnia.
Arizona Emergency Information Network	https://ein.az.gov/hazards/landslides-debris-flow	Arizona	NA	English	Landslide	Landslides & Debris Flow In a landslide, masses of rock, earth or debris move down a slope. Debris and mud flows are rivers of rock, earth, and other debris saturated with water. They can flow quickly, striking with little or no warning at high speeds. They can travel several miles from their source, growing in size as they pick up trees, boulders, cars and other materials.  Landslides are caused by a variety of factors, including earthquakes, storms, volcanic eruptions, fire and by human modification of land. Landslides can occur quickly, often with little notice. The best way to prepare is to stay informed about changes in and around your area that could signal that a landslide or debris flow is likely to occur. For example, when a wildfire creates a “burn scar” on a slope, the chance of debris flow and flooding increases for years.   Although some landslides require lengthy rain and saturated slopes, a debris flow can start on a dry slope after only a few minutes of intense rain, like Arizona’s monsoons. “Intense” rain means a burst of rain at a fast rate, about half an inch in an hour. With debris flows, the rate matters more than total rainfall.  BEFORE  Build an emergency go kit and make a family communication plan. Become familiar with the land around you at home and when traveling, particularly in areas impacted by wildfire. Learn whether debris flows have occurred in your area by contacting local officials. Slopes where debris flows have occurred in the past are likely to experience them in the future. Connect with your local county or tribal emergency management office and sign up for alerts Prepare for landslides by following proper land-use procedures - avoid building near steep slopes, close to mountain edges, near drainage ways, or along natural erosion valleys. Consult a professional for advice on appropriate preventative measures for your home or business, such as flexible pipe fittings, which can better resist breakage. Protect your property based on local city, county, or tribal guidance on protection from debris flow and flooding.  You can't stop or change the path of a debris flow. However, you may be able to protect your property from floodwaters or mud by use of sandbags, retaining walls or k-rails (Jersey barriers). Be aware, if you divert debris flow and the flow lands onto a neighbor's property, you may be liable for damages. If you are at risk from a landslide talk to your insurance agent. Debris flow may be covered by flood insurance policies from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)(link is external)  Recognize the Warning Signs  Watch for debris flows and other fast moving landslides that pose threats to life: If you are near a wildfire burn area, sign up for emergency alerts and pay attention to weather forecasts for the burn area. The weather in the burn area could be very different from where you are. Huge boulders in the landscape can be signs of past debris flows. Listen and watch for rushing water, mud, unusual sounds. A faint rumbling sound that increases in volume is noticeable as the landslide nears. Watch for slow-moving landslides that pose threats to property:  Changes occur in your landscape such as patterns of storm-water drainage on slopes (especially the places where runoff water converges) land movement, small slides, flows, or progressively leaning trees. Doors or windows stick or jam for the first time. New cracks appear in plaster, tile, brick, or foundations. Outside walls, walks, or stairs begin pulling away from the building. Underground utility lines break. Water breaks through the ground surface in new locations. Close   DURING During a severe storm, stay alert and awake. Many deaths from landslides occur while people are sleeping. Heed all warnings and evacuation notices. Listen to local news stations for warnings. Have a battery-powered radio available.  Move away from the path of a landslide or debris flow as quickly as possible. The danger from a mudflow increases near stream channels and with prolonged heavy rains. Mudflows can move faster than you can walk or run. Look upstream before crossing a bridge and do not cross the bridge if a mudflow is approaching. Avoid river valleys and low-lying areas. If you are near a stream or channel, be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow and notice whether the water changes from clear to muddy. Such changes may mean there is debris flow activity upstream, so be prepared to move quickly. Close   AFTER Watch for flooding, which may occur after a landslide or debris flow. Floods sometimes follow landslides and debris flows because they may both be started by the same event. Stay away from the slide area. There may be danger of additional slides. Listen to local radio or television stations for the latest emergency information. Check for injured and trapped persons near the slide, without entering the direct slide area. Direct rescuers to their locations. Report broken utility lines and damaged roadways and railways to appropriate authorities. Reporting potential hazards will get the utilities turned off as quickly as possible, preventing further hazard and injury. Replant damaged ground as soon as possible since erosion caused by loss of ground cover can lead to flash flooding and additional landslides in the near future. Seek advice from a geotechnical expert for evaluating landslide hazards or designing corrective techniques to reduce landslide risk. A professional will be able to advise you of the best ways to prevent or reduce landslide risk, without creating further hazard.

They can grow exponentially in size as they travel several miles from their source, accumulating trees, boulders, cars, and other materials.  Landslides are the result of various factors, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, storms, fire, and human land modifications. Debris flows and landslides can occur rapidly, almost always without forewarning. To prepare for such events, it's vital to remain up-to-date about changes that occur in and around your area. For example, a "burn scar" created by a wildfire on a slope indicates that the odds of a debris flow or flooding will be elevated for many years.  Although some landslides require prolonged periods of rain and saturated slopes, a debris flow may commence on dry terrain following just a few minutes of rain, such as during Arizona's monsoons. It's worth noting that the intensity of the rain, around half an inch per hour at a fast rate, is more influential than the overall amount of rainfall in terms of debris flow events.  Recognize the Warning Signs  Watch for debris flows and other fast moving landslides that pose threats to life: If you are near a wildfire burn area, sign up for emergency alerts and pay attention to weather forecasts for the burn area. The weather in the burn area could be very different from where you are. Huge boulders in the landscape can be signs of past debris flows. Listen and watch for rushing water, mud, unusual sounds. A faint rumbling sound that increases in volume is noticeable as the landslide nears. Watch for slow-moving landslides that pose threats to property: Changes occur in your landscape such as patterns of storm-water drainage on slopes (especially the places where runoff water converges) land movement, small slides, flows, or progressively leaning trees. Doors or windows stick or jam for the first time. New cracks appear in plaster, tile, brick, or foundations. Outside walls, walks, or stairs begin pulling away from the building. Underground utility lines break. Water breaks through the ground surface in new locations. During During a severe storm, stay alert and awake. Many deaths from landslides occur while people are sleeping. Heed all warnings and evacuation notices. Listen to local news stations for warnings. Have a battery-powered radio available.  Move away from the path of a landslide or debris flow as quickly as possible. The danger from a mudflow increases near stream channels and with prolonged heavy rains. Mudflows can move faster than you can walk or run. Look upstream before crossing a bridge and do not cross the bridge if a mudflow is approaching. Avoid river valleys and low-lying areas. If you are near a stream or channel, be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow and notice whether the water changes from clear to muddy. Such changes may mean there is debris flow activity upstream, so be prepared to move quickly. After Watch for flooding, which may occur after a landslide or debris flow. Floods sometimes follow landslides and debris flows because they may both be started by the same event. Stay away from the slide area. There may be danger of additional slides. Listen to local radio or television stations for the latest emergency information. Check for injured and trapped persons near the slide, without entering the direct slide area. Direct rescuers to their locations. Report broken utility lines and damaged roadways and railways to appropriate authorities. Reporting potential hazards will get the utilities turned off as quickly as possible, preventing further hazard and injury. Replant damaged ground as soon as possible since erosion caused by loss of ground cover can lead to flash flooding and additional landslides in the near future. Seek advice from a geotechnical expert for evaluating landslide hazards or designing corrective techniques to reduce landslide risk. A professional will be able to advise you of the best ways to prevent or reduce landslide risk, without creating further hazard.

State Farm	https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/ways-to-stay-safe-during-a-severe-wind-event	National	6/8/2023	English	Severe Weather Statement, Wind Advisory	Ways to stay safe during a severe storm or wind event Preparing for a severe storm or wind emergency may help minimize damage to your property.  Severe weather safety tips During severe weather events like hurricanes and tornadoes, winds can reach speeds greater than 100 miles per hour. High winds of any speed, however, can damage homes and property, and cause flying debris and broken glass which could cause potential injury. Proper planning may help save your family from injury and inconvenience when severe weather strikes. Prepare your family by creating a disaster preparedness plan, including a disaster survival kit and an emergency evacuation plan.  Stay informed Listen and watch for weather updates and advisories. Getting up-to-the-minute information is an important part of staying safe in any weather emergency. Tune in to a NOAA Weather Radio, battery-powered radio or cell phone for updates and mobile alerts. Wind advisory. A high wind advisory means that sustained winds of over 25 miles per hour are predicted. Take warnings seriously. Thunderstorm, tornado and hurricane warnings should be taken very seriously, as they mean that severe weather has been spotted and is on its way. Find shelter during severe weather Take shelter in a safe location. Move to the middle of your home or basement, away from windows and glass doors. Try to take cover under a staircase or a heavy piece of furniture. Evacuate manufactured homes. Do not stay in a manufactured home during severe winds. They are easily overturned by high winds, and flying debris can puncture their light frames and exteriors. Consider building a safe room. If you live in an area prone to severe winds, you may want to build a safe room in your home. A safe room is an area of your home that has been reinforced to provide protection from broken glass and flying debris. An experienced contractor can build a safe room with a reinforced roof, walls and ceilings in a new or existing home. Bring a disaster kit. Wherever you seek shelter, remember to bring your family disaster kit with you. Tips to help protect your property from severe weather and wind events Vehicles. Garage or store vehicles you plan to leave behind. If you don't have a garage, move them to higher ground, in case of flooding. Boats. Develop a plan and a checklist to help protect your boat in case of storms or hurricanes. Determine the safest place for your boat to ride out a storm ahead of time so it's easier to take action. Remove all externally mounted electronics that might be damaged by a storm. If your boat must remain in the water, avoid low dock pilings and narrow boat slips; both increase the potential for damage. Check with your marina about any guidelines or contractual requirements to safeguard your boat in the event of heavy weather. Surroundings. Place garbage cans, patio furniture, grills and other potentially wind-borne objects inside your home or garage Board your residence up. Board up windows and glass doors with shutters or plywood to minimize damage from broken glass, in case of high winds. Secure and shut off your outdoor pool. Turn off the circuit breaker to your outdoor pool and remove the motor to prevent damage. Remove risky tree branches. Prune branches that might break off during the storm and either hurt someone or cause damage to your home or vehicles. Rent or purchase a generator. If you can rent or purchase a generator, it might help keep refrigerators, freezers and lights on. A powerful storm can knock out power to your home for days, even weeks. Manufactured homes. Even when equipped with new straps and tie-downs, manufactured homes may expose occupants to a greater risk of injury than structures with permanent foundations. Weather advisories. Monitor the radio for weather updates. If you are instructed to evacuate, go to a shelter as directed by local authorities and: Lock doors and windows before you go. Bring your survival kit and other supplies. For a helpful list of what your kit should include, visit American Red Cross. Let friends and relatives know where you plan to be. If there is no time to get to a shelter, retreat to your safe room if you have one. Otherwise, stay in the middle of your home or basement, away from windows, and try to take cover under a staircase or a heavy piece of furniture.  Tips for surviving severe storms Anyone who's ever survived a severe storm or hurricane knows that the damage to home and property can be overwhelming — emotionally and financially. The property damage attributed to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 hit $190 billion, and property damage attributed to Hurricane Sandy in 2012 hit almost $84 billion. The annual hurricane season traditionally runs from June 1 to November 30, but a severe storm can appear suddenly at any time of the year.  What you can do now to help prepare for storms Organize important papers. Gather your important papers and store them off-site, in a bank safe-deposit box or some other secure location. Your mortgage, home and auto insurance policies, birth certificates, passports and other important papers should be in a safe, dry location that you can access even if your home is damaged. Store other papers and keepsakes in plastic, sealable bags on a high shelf to help avoid flood damage. Create a home inventory. Having an inventory or list of your possessions will expedite insurance claims after the storm. Keep it with your important papers off-site. It's much easier to file a claim with an existing inventory rather than trying to create one during the stressful post-storm period. Put together an emergency kit. The type of emergency kit needed will depend on where you live and the type of emergencies you may encounter. These items can come in handy if you have to leave your home and temporarily move into a public shelter. Create an easily accessible emergency fund. If you can do this, it will help make your post-storm recovery smoother.
Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management	https://oklahoma.gov/oem/programs-and-services/preparedness/preparedness-tornadoes.html#:~:text=A%20reinforced%20underground%20storm%20shelter,a%20tornado%27s%20most%20lethal%20weapon	Oklahoma	NA	English	Tornado Warning	Tornadoes  Description The tornado is the most violent storm on Earth. A tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air extending to the ground from a thunderstorm cloud. The path width of a tornado is usually very narrow, but can range up to a half-mile or more in the most extreme cases. Tornadoes usually only last a few minutes, but a few can last for much longer, traveling along the ground for several miles. Tornadoes can remain almost stationary, or can race across the countryside at speeds over 50 mph. Violent winds in and near the tornado can cause incredible destruction, and can generate flying debris, which is the main thing that hurts people in tornadoes.  Tornado Safety Keeping informed about the weather is the best way to avoid being caught in a tornado or severe thunderstorm. Your local National Weather Service Forecast Office provides information about dangerous weather in your area, and you should keep a close eye on this information whenever storms threaten your area. A battery operated NOAA Weather Radio with a warning alarm feature should be a part of your information system!  It’s also critical that you think about tornado safety long before there’s a storm on the horizon, and plan what you will do to stay safe no matter where you may be when storms threaten.  When a severe storm or tornado threatens, remember these basic guidelines:  GET IN - get as far inside a strong building as you can, away from doors and windows  GET DOWN - get to the lowest floor  COVER UP - use whatever you can to protect yourself from flying or falling debris  A reinforced underground storm shelter, storm cellar, enclosed basement or safe room are usually the safest places in a tornado. Underground shelters get you out of the way of flying and falling debris, which is a tornado’s most lethal weapon. If you cannot get underground, remember the basic guidelines. Get as far inside the strongest building you can find. Stay away from doors, windows and other openings to the outside. Put as many walls between you and the outside as you can. Get as low as you can. Go to the lowest floor of the building you’re in. Cover up to protect yourself from flying and falling debris. Use whatever you can find - pillows, blankets, sleeping bags, mattresses. Wearing a helmet or hardhat will help protect your head from debris. Being outdoors, in a mobile home, or in a vehicle are all unsafe in a tornado or severe thunderstorm. Find stronger shelter before the storm arrives and remember to get in, get down and cover up.
Oklahoma State University Department of Public Safety	https://safety.okstate.edu/safety-resources/weather/severe-storms-and-tornadoes.html	Oklahoma	NA	English	Tornado Warning	Severe Storms and Tornadoes  You are responsible for ﬁnding an area of refuge in the event of a tornado. Monitor weather reports and go to these buildings when it begins to storm. If the sirens are sounding, it is too late to seek other shelter. Unfortunately, taking pets into approved storm shelters is strongly discouraged because it limits the space available for the campus community seeking shelter.   If the building you are in does not have a basement, go to the ground ﬂoor and enter an interior (windowless) room or hallway. It is too risky to go to another building once the sirens have sounded.  Shut off equipment that might be affected by a temporary loss of electricity. Close hallway doors as you leave to shield the corridors from ﬂying debris. Stay away from windows. Use telephones for emergency calls only. Stay calm and alert. If local radio is available, keep tuned to KOSU-FM (91.7 MHz), KSPI-FM (93.7 MHz), KVRO-FM (98.1 MHz) or KGFY-FM (105.5 MHz) for storm details. Dial 911 to report injuries and emergencies caused by the storm. Call Facilities Management Work Control at 744-7154 to report all damage. There will not be an all clear signal from the alert sirens. Additional blasts indicate a new or renewed alert. Report locations of trapped persons, making note of persons with injuries and/or disabilities.  Persons with Disabilities Persons with disabilities who are mobility impaired must also make plans. If a power outage occurs during severe weather, elevators may not work. Go to a small interior room or closet (or a landing in an interior stairwell). Stay away from windows and exterior walls. Tell someone where you will be going and take a cell phone, if possible.  Tornado Tips In the event of tornadoes, basements generally offer the best protection. Otherwise go into an interior room (bathroom/shower) or hallway on the lowest floor possible. Put as many walls as possible between you and the outside as possible. Get under a piece of sturdy furniture, such as a workbench or heavy table or desk and hold on to it. Avoid large open rooms, if possible. Crouch as low as possible to the floor, facing down, and cover your head with your hands. Even in an interior room, you should cover yourself with some sort of thick padding (a mattress, blankets, etc.), to protect against falling debris and flying objects in case the roof and ceiling fail. Faculty, staff, and/or students should remain at your chosen "Safe Area" location until advised that it is safe to return to their regular work or study area or to leave the building until the tornado or severe weather has passed and you have received an all clear via the local media. Remember, there is no “all clear” siren activation. Weather, especially a severe storm, is unpredictable or the storm may have several lines of developing storms and as each approaching threat reaches the city, another siren notification may be sounded. Give serious consideration to using a portable battery operated radio “tuned to a local broadcast station” (KSPI FM-93.7, KSPI AM-780 DAYTIME ONLY, KVRO FM-101.1, KGFY FM-105.5, KOSU FM-91.7) to provide you with local warning information and to let you know when the severe weather has passed.
Oklahoma City Emergency Management	https://www.okc.gov/residents/prepare-okc/know-what-to-do/tornadoes	Oklahoma	NA	English	Tornado Warning	Tornadoes are the world's most violent atmospheric storms. They are narrow, violently rotating columns of air extending from the base of a thunderstorm to the ground, and they are sometimes hard or impossible to see. Read more below about tornadoes to help you make a plan and build a kit.  Have at least 3 ways to get weather information Wherever you are during a severe weather threat, be sure to have at least three ways to get information about the weather.  At least one method should work without electric power, without batteries and without a cellular or wifi signal.  Many weather radios have hand-powered cranks for use if you don’t have power or batteries. They’re available to buy locally at many general merchandise retailers, and online.  The best sources to get weather related warnings are in this order:  NOAA Weather Radio All-Hazards Smartphone or tablet app, like the Emergency app from the American Red Cross for iOS (Apple) and Android devices. Outdoor warning sirens if you are outdoors. Although they should not be your only sources for weather warnings, the following can be used as secondary sources with the primary sources listed above:  Local television, radio and multimedia news organizations, on traditional (TV and radio) and streaming platforms. The local National Weather Service website, mobile website and Twitter account. The City of Oklahoma City’s Twitter and Facebook accounts. Outdoor Warning Sirens OKC's outdoor warning sirens sound in and near areas where the National Weather Service has issued a tornado warning. If you hear a siren, immediately take shelter and get more information about the storm.  There is no all-clear signal.  OKC tests its sirens at noon on Saturdays unless there's a threat of inclement weather.  Use OKC's Accessible Hazard Alert System to receive alerts in American Sign Language and English voice and text.  Sirens should be only one of at least three ways you have to get information about the weather, including an NOAA weather radio, AM-FM radio, television, online news source or smartphone app.   Never rely only on sirens or any other single source of information as your only cue for deciding to take shelter.  Tornado Watches and Warnings The National Weather Service (NWS) monitors thunderstorms for tornadoes. The NWS issues a tornado watch when weather conditions are favorable for tornadoes, and you should pay close attention to the weather. The NWS issues a tornado warning for confirmed or radar-indicated tornadoes. Immediately take shelter and seek more information.  Stay aware of the weather, including for NWS tornado watches and warnings, by paying attention to weather sources like local television stations, radio, online news sources and smartphone apps. You should always have a battery-powered or hand-cranked NOAA Weather radio in your disaster kit as a backup, and don't forget extra batteries.  Use OKC's Accessible Hazard Alert System to receive alerts in American Sign Language and English voice and text.  Tornado Safety Get inside a well-constructed building and seek shelter if a tornado is nearby. Flying debris is the greatest danger.  The safest place to be is a storm shelter built to FEMA guidelines and ICC 500 standards, or a basement.  If there's no storm shelter, get to the inner-most room, hallway or closet on the lowest level of the building. Put as many walls between you and the outside as possible, and stay away from windows and doors. Most houses provide life-saving protection from 98 percent of tornadoes in Oklahoma.   Wear a helmet and/or use pillows, cushions and thick blankets for additional protection. Wear sturdy shoes that will protect your feet if you have to walk through debris.  Vehicles are unsafe in tornadoes. Many deaths are attributable to being inside a vehicle when a tornado strikes. If you're driving when a tornado threat is nearby, get to the closest well-constructed building to take shelter. Never attempt to outrun a tornado by driving.  Mobile homes are unsafe in tornadoes. Have a plan to get to the nearest well-constructed building to take shelter.  Oklahoma City doesn't have public tornado shelters. Read more about why.  If you have a storm shelter at your home, register it with the City of OKC so emergency crews know where to find you in a disaster.
Midwest City, OK city website	https://www.midwestcityok.org/emergency-management/page/tornado-safety-guidelines	Oklahoma	NA	English	Tornado Warning	Tornado Safety Guidelines Your best defense against a tornado is to:  Have a safety plan and practice it Pay attention to your local weather information, and Act quickly if a tornado threatens your area Your chances of surviving even the strongest tornado are excellent if you follow these basic guidelines, even if no safe room or underground shelter is available.  BEFORE Develop a severe weather safety plan. Consider what actions you would take at home, work, school, or while commuting. Make sure you and your family understand where to go to stay safe in a tornado. Practice your plan. Do it now – don’t wait until storms are forecast!  Your safety depends on you being aware of the latest severe weather outlooks, watches, and warnings. Have at least three different ways to get life-saving warnings.  Different options include: NOAA weather radio National Weather Service website Local TV and Radio Weather apps for smartphones - no matter how many of these you have, they only count as one method Municipal or County sirens - but ONLY if you are outdoors; Sirens are not intended to be heard indoors! Know the difference between a watch and a warning: WATCH - Conditions are present for tornado development in or near the watch area. Tornadoes are possible.  this is a good time to to review and discuss your emergency plans and check your supplies. WARNING - Take shelter immediately! A tornado has been sighted or indicated by radar. Warnings are typically for a much smaller area than watches. WHEN STORMS THREATEN Stay calm, act quickly, and rely on your safety plan. The safest place to be in a tornado is an underground storm shelter, above ground safe room, or basement. If no underground shelter or safe room is available, go to the lowest level of a sturdy building or your home. Put as many walls between you and the outside direction of the storm as possible. Avoid windows, doors, and exterior walls. Closets and bathrooms are often good choices. Close all interior doors If possible, get under a sturdy table or desk. Cover up with thick items such as pillows or cushions to protect against flying debris. Put on a helmet if you have one If you are in a mobile home, in a vehicle, or outdoors, find a storm shelter or sturdy building quickly. Cars, trucks, and mobile homes offer little protection. You should NOT be in a mobile home or a vehicle during a tornado. If you will need to travel to get to a safe place, you need to plan to leave very early to avoid being caught in the weather or the traffic of other people trying to get to shelter.
Edmond, OK city website	https://www.edmondok.gov/494/What-To-Do-During-a-Tornado	Oklahoma	NA	English	Tornado Warning	What To Do During a Tornado If you are under a tornado WARNING, seek shelter immediately!  If you are in: A structure (e.g. residence, small building, school, nursing home, hospital, factory, shopping center, high-rise building)  Go to a pre-designated shelter area such as a safe room, basement, storm cellar, or the lowest building level. If there is no basement, go to the center of an interior room on the lowest level (closet, interior hallway) away from corners, windows, doors, and outside walls. Put as many walls as possible between you and the outside. Get under a sturdy table and use your arms to protect your head and neck. Do not open windows. If you are in: A vehicle, trailer, or mobile home  Get out immediately and go to the lowest floor of a sturdy, nearby building or a storm shelter. Mobile homes, even if tied down, offer little protection from tornadoes. If you are: Outside with no shelter  Lie flat in a nearby ditch or depression and cover your head with your hands. Be aware of the potential for flooding. Do not get under an overpass or bridge. You are safer in a low, flat location. Never try to outrun a tornado in urban or congested areas in a car or truck. Instead, leave the vehicle immediately for safe shelter. Watch out for flying debris. Flying debris from tornadoes causes most fatalities and injuries.
Oklahoma Emergency Medical Services Authority 	https://emsaonline.com/resource-library/summer-safety-tips/safest-places-to-be-during-a-tornado/	Oklahoma	NA	English	Tornado Warning	Safest Places to Be During a Tornado If a tornado has been spotted or indicated by weather radar, you need to seek shelter immediately. Of course, the safest place to be when a tornado approaches is in a basement or storm shelter underground. But if you are not able to get to a shelter or basement, you need to find shelter that is available.  If you are at home  If you have a cellar, storm shelter, safe room or basement available, go immediately to that area. If none of these options are available to you, get to the lowest level of your home. Get to a windowless interior room, such as a bathroom, closet or inner hallway. Stay as far from windows as possible. Go to the center of the room – corners tend to attract debris. Get under a sturdy piece of furniture; heavy table or desk, and hold on to it. Protect your head and neck with a blanket, if possible. If you are in a mobile home  Mobile homes are particularly vulnerable to tornadoes. They can be easily overturned, even if precautions have been taken to tie down the unit. If you are in a mobile home when a tornado is approaching, evacuate the home immediately.  Take shelter in a building with a strong foundation If a shelter is not available, lie in a ditch or low-lying area a safe distance away from the mobile home. Use your arms to protect head and neck If you are at work or school  Go to the basement or an inside hallway at the lowest level Avoid places with wide-span roofs such as auditoriums, cafeterias, gymnasiums, large hallways or shopping malls Get under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a desk or heavy table. Use your arms to protect head and neck If you are outdoors  If possible, get inside a building. If shelter is unavailable or there is no time to get indoors, lie in a ditch or low-lying area or crouch near a strong building. Use your arms to protect your head and neck Stay alert to the potential for flooding If you are in a vehicle  Never try to outrun a tornado. Tornadoes can change direction quickly and can instantly lift up a car, truck or any other vehicle and toss it through the air. Get out of the vehicle immediately and take shelter in a nearby building If there is no time to get indoors, get out of the vehicle and lie in a ditch or low-lying area away from the vehicle Use your arms to protect your head and neck Stay alert to the potential for flooding
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/features/tornadosafety/index.html	National	4/3/2023	English	Tornado Warning	Staying Safe in a Tornado Español (Spanish) Print The funnel of a tornado touches the ground in a rural field churning up debris. To stay safe during a tornado, prepare a plan and an emergency kit, stay aware of weather conditions during thunderstorms, know the best places to shelter both indoors and outdoors, and always protect yourself from injury, especially your head.  Tornadoes continue to impact locations across the country every year, bringing massive winds and destruction of properties in their paths.  The 2022 tornado season claimed the lives of 23 individuals, injured hundreds more, and caused billions of dollars in damage. The deadliest outbreak occurred in March with 12 deaths. Historically, most tornadoes occur in spring; however, tornadoes can happen at any time. While the likelihood of a tornado occurring on a December day in the United States is 12-15% (compared to 90% in early June), in recent years, tornado outbreaks during winter months have been deadly.  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) there is no guaranteed safety during a tornado. Even the possibility of a tornado must be taken seriously. Although the most violent tornadoes can level and blow away almost any house and those within it, extremely violent EF5 tornadoes (those with wind speeds of 200 MPH or more) are rare. It’s been over eight years since the last catastrophic EF5 tornado struck the United States, occurring in Moore, Oklahoma, on May 20, 2013. Most tornadoes are much weaker. You can survive a tornado if you follow safety precautions. Here are three important tips to help keep you and your family safe.  Storm cellar  TIP ❶: Be prepared. The best way to stay safe during a tornado is to be prepared with the following items:  Fresh batteries and a battery-operated TV, radio, or internet-enabled device to listen to the latest emergency weather information A tornado emergency plan including access to a safe shelter for yourself, your family, people with special needs, and your pets An emergency kit (including water, non-perishable food, and medication) A list of important information, including telephone numbers Be sure your children know what a tornado is, what tornado watches and warnings are, what county or parish they live in (warnings are typically issued by county or parish), and what makes a location a safe shelter, whether at home or at school.  TIP ❷: Stay aware of weather conditions. To protect yourself and your loved ones from harm during a tornado, pay close attention to changing weather conditions in your area. If you know thunderstorms are expected, stay tuned to local radio and TV stations or a NOAA weather radio station for further weather information. Some tornadoes strike rapidly without time for a tornado warning. The following weather signs may mean that a tornado is approaching:  A dark or green-colored sky A large, dark, low-lying cloud Large hail A loud roar that sounds like a freight train If you notice any of these conditions, take cover immediately, and stay tuned to local radio and TV stations, a NOAA weather radio station, or the internet.  TIP ❸: Know where to shelter. Falling and flying debris causes most injuries and deaths during a tornado. Although there is no completely safe place during a tornado, some locations are much safer than others.  Go to the basement or an inside room without windows on the lowest floor (bathroom, closet, center hallway). If possible, avoid sheltering in any room with windows. For added protection get under something sturdy (a heavy table or workbench). Cover your body with a blanket, sleeping bag or mattress. Protect your head with anything available. Do not stay in a mobile home. If you are outside or in a mobile home, find a nearby building, preferably with a basement. If you are in a car, do not try to outrun a tornado, but instead find the nearest sturdy building.  No one can know a tornado’s strength before it touches down, so keep up with local weather information, especially when thunderstorms are forecasted. Prepare your home and family for the possibility of a tornado. Moving to a shelter quickly is easier when everyone knows where to go, whether in your home or outdoors. Following these tips will give you the best chance for staying safe.  Learn more about how to stay safe during a tornado.
National Child Traumatic Stress Network	https://www.nctsn.org/what-is-child-trauma/trauma-types/disasters/tornado-resources	National	NA	English	Tornado Warning	Definition A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. They usually appear as a funnel or cone-shaped cloud, with wind speeds of up to 300 miles per hour. They can cause major destruction in their path. Sometimes tornadoes are preceded by heavy rain, wind, and hail; at other times they seem to arise out of relatively clear conditions. Sometimes people hear a loud roar or trainlike sound when a tornado approaches. Tornadoes have occurred in all fifty states and at all times of year. However, the Midwestern and Southern states have the greatest number, and the most violent tornadoes tend to be in the spring. Areas prone to tornadoes usually have a warning system to alert residents that they should seek safe shelter. Being prepared beforehand is the best way to help children and family members recover after a tornado. To improve their preparedness, families should:  Develop a plan to shelter in place. Have families identify the safest place in their home, such as a basement or the lowest building level in a room without windows (e.g., closet or bathroom). Have them include a place to meet after a tornado as they could be separated during the storm and at least two escape routes from home and work/school. It is important that they know the emergency plan at work and their children’s school emergency plan. If any family members have special mobility or health conditions, make sure the plan incorporates their needs and enlists others nearby in case they are alone during a tornado. Make a family preparedness and communication plan. Families need to have important contact information easily accessible, know whom they might stay with in the event of an evacuation, and have a plan for pets and livestock. Download the family preparedness plan and wallet card to help with this process. Regularly practice the emergency plan. Every 3 months families should practice taking shelter in the designated safe place and reviewing where to meet after a tornado. Be informed about local tornado sirens and how to access updated official tornado information. Encourage families to learn when and how often tornado sirens are tested in their community. Also have them identify which official radio stations, websites, or social media will provide tornado updates. Help families become familiar with different tornado alerts: Tornado Watch: Indicates weather conditions are favorable for forming a tornado and people need to monitor for changing weather conditions or updated alerts. Tornado Warning: Indicates that a tornado has formed and people need to seek shelter quickly. Assemble an emergency supply kit. Families should have access to enough water, food, and other emergency supplies for at least 3 days and medications for at least 7 days. Encourage them to gather copies of important documents, a radio and batteries as needed for weather updates, supplies for pets, and safety gear (such as helmets to protect both children and adults). Plan for children’s needs. Encourage parents and caregivers to give children factual information about tornadoes in simple terms. This includes having them learn the warning conditions (e.g., loud roaring sound; dark, greenish sky; large hail, seeing a funnel cloud) as well as what to do when they hear the tornado sirens. For adolescents who are driving or out in public, discuss with them good places to take shelter. The Help Kids Cope app provides parents with tips for how to talk with children of different developmental levels. Knowing what to do during a tornado can help families feel more in control and take steps to increase their safety.  When a tornado warning is issued or a tornado is seen, families should:  Take shelter immediately. Everyone needs to move to a safe location in a basement, center hallway, or bathroom on the lowest floor. A room without windows, not near outside walls, or not near corners is best. Families that are in a trailer or mobile home should exit immediately and go to the lowest floor of a nearby building or shelter. When outside and shelter is not nearby, individuals need to find a ditch or area lower than the ground and lie down. Take protective measures. It is best to wear sturdy shoes, get under a sturdy piece of furniture, and wear helmets. If no helmets are available, individuals should use their arms and hands to protect their heads. Keep pets sheltered and under control. Families should take their pets to where they are sheltering and keep them under their direct control. Stay informed about tornado alerts and current weather updates. Families should not leave their shelter until officials have announced that the storm as passed. Immediately after a tornado has passed, families should:  Evaluate for injuries. Parents and caregivers need to check that their families and those around them were not injured. Immediate medical assistance or basic first aid may be needed. Evaluate the safety of their home. Parents and caregivers should walk through all rooms of their house and determine if it is safe to remain living in it. They need to clean up any spilled medications, bleaches, or flammable liquids that could become a fire hazard. If they can smell gas or hear a blowing or hissing noise, they should open a window, get everyone out quickly, and call the gas company or fire department. Evaluate the safety of their yard and surrounding area. Parents and caregivers should scan their yard to make sure it is safe for children to come outside. If they notice fallen power lines, they should be encouraged to report them to the utility company immediately. Use protective clothing when evaluating safety. Families should wear a mask when around debris and long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, and sturdy shoes when examining the house for damage. To address children’s reactions during a tornado, parents and caregivers can:  Model calm behavior. Children tend to mirror the reactions of adults around them and will learn ideas for how to take care of themselves from what parents and caregivers do. Provide simple but accurate information in a quiet, steady voice. Discuss with children what has happened and what will happen next (e.g., need to move to a shelter, one parent is helping a neighbor). Encourage comforting or distracting activities. Children may benefit from doing slow breathing to calm their bodies or having a stuffed animal or blanket to hold. As electricity may be out for a long period of times, children will benefit from being distracted. The following handouts are activities children can do inside. Practice their own self-care. Parents and caregivers may benefit from finding opportunities to take a moment for themselves, express their feelings, acknowledge that it is a scary situation, and engage in a coping strategy to calm themselves. Tornadoes are unusual storms, as their path is often erratic. In the same neighborhood, some houses may be completely damaged while others will have not been impacted. While scattered destruction can be easier on the community than that of a flood or a hurricane (in that not all community resources may be used up), the inconsistent pattern of damage can cause feelings of guilt in those spared or unfairness in those recovering. Children may develop unusual ideas or myths about why a tornado did or did not hit their home.  In early aftermath, children may see anxiety and fear in parents and caregivers who are usually confident. They may have to move out of their area or seek temporary housing. They may have lost some of their treasured toys and memorabilia or have lost contact with those supports in their life (e.g., teachers, friends, neighbors) who provided them comfort. If they remain in the area, they tend to be exposed to reminders including rubble, debris, and changes in landscape (e.g., trees without leaves, broken branches).  As with other natural disasters, there will be a spectrum of reactions that children and families will experience. They may worry  that another tornado will occur, feel troubled when reminded about the tornado (e.g., dark and low clouds, sounds of strong winds, siren test), and worry when separated from their loved ones. They may exhibit different behaviors (e.g., withdrawal from usual activities, increased anxiety level) or report more physical complaints. Children will react differently depending on their age, developmental level, and prior experiences. Responses  also depend on the significance of secondary stresses they are exposed to (e.g., family changes, number of moves, family financial hardship). In general, most families will recover over time, particularly with the support of family, friends, and organizations. Since tornadoes impact communities erratically, some families will be able to return to their normal routines rather quickly, while others will have to contend with numerous hardships, losses, and potentially medical rehabilitation (if there were family members injured). Understanding children’s typical reactions will help ensure they get the right supports.  Children’s functioning and recovery will be influenced by how their parents and caregivers cope after the tornado. Children often turn to adults for information, comfort, and help. To assist children, discuss with parents and caregivers ways to:  Model how they handle stressful situations in front of their children Provide accurate information to their children about what happened during the storm as well as what changes the family is facing. Answer questions honestly but with the amount of detail appropriate to their developmental level Give themselves their own time to process what is happening Keep family routines as regular as possible, even in the early recovery phase Monitor the media and social media information children are viewing and set limits if children are overly focused on viewing this content. Seek additional help for themselves or their children if behavioral changes or reactions worsen or if they persist over six weeks after the hurricane.

Tornadoes can destroy buildings, flip cars, and create deadly flying debris.  A tornado can:  Happen anytime and anywhere. Bring intense winds, over 200 miles per hour. Look like funnels. alert - warning If you are under a tornado or severe weather warning:  Go to NOAA Weather Radio and your local news or official social media accounts for updated emergency information. Follow the instructions of state, local and tribal officials.  Go to a safe shelter immediately, such as a safe room, basement, storm cellar or a small interior room on the lowest level of a sturdy building. Stay away from windows, doors, and outside walls. Do not go under an overpass or bridge. You’re safer in a low, flat location. Watch out for flying debris that can cause injury or death. Use your arms to protect your head and neck. If you can’t stay at home, make plans to go to a public shelter. Preparing for a Tornado Know your area’s tornado risk. In the U.S., the Midwest and the Southeast have a greater risk for tornadoes. Know the signs of a tornado, including a rotating, funnel-shaped cloud, an approaching cloud of debris, or a loud roar like a freight train. Sign up for your community’s warning system. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) and NOAA Weather Radio also provide emergency alerts. If your community has sirens, then become familiar with the warning tone. Pay attention to weather reports. Meteorologists can predict when conditions might be right for a tornado. Identify and practice going to a safe shelter such as a safe room built using FEMA criteria or a storm shelter built to ICC 500 standards. The next best protection is a small, interior, windowless room or basement on the lowest level of a sturdy building. Plan for your pet. They are an important member of your family, so they need to be included in your family’s emergency plan. Prepare for long-term stay at home or sheltering in place by gathering emergency supplies, cleaning supplies, non-perishable foods, water, medical supplies and medication. Staying Safe During a Tornado Immediately go to a safe location that you have identified. Pay attention to EAS, NOAA Weather Radio, or local alerting systems for current emergency information and instructions. Protect yourself by covering your head or neck with your arms and putting materials such as furniture and blankets around or on top of you. Do not try to outrun a tornado in a vehicle if you are in a car. If you are in a car or outdoors and cannot get to a building, cover your head and neck with your arms and cover your body with a coat or blanket, if possible. Staying Safe After a Tornado Save your phone calls for emergencies and use text messaging or social media to communicate with family and friends.  Pay attention to EAS, NOAA Weather Radio, and local authorities for updated information. Stay clear of fallen power lines or broken utility lines. Contact your healthcare provider if you are sick and need medical attention. Wait for further care instructions and continue to shelter in place. Wear appropriate gear during clean-up such as thick-soled shoes, long pants, and work gloves, use appropriate face coverings or masks if cleaning mold or other debris.

Integris Health	https://integrisok.com/resources/on-your-health/2019/april/preparing-for-emergencies-oklahoma-tornado-season	Oklahoma	4/4/2019	English	Tornado Warning, Severe Weather Statement	Preparing for Emergencies: Oklahoma Tornado Season  In Oklahoma, tornado season is always “just around the corner.” Whether you’re a newbie or you’ve lived in Oklahoma your entire life, one thing is for sure — storm season here is no joke.  Oklahoma is located in the heart of Tornado Alley, so twisters and other severe weather can be common. Although most tornadoes hit the state in the months of April and May, they can occur anytime during the year if the conditions are right.  Tornadoes are destructive storms that can destroy buildings, toss cars around and create deadly flying debris. Violently rotating columns of air that extend from a thunderstorm to the ground, tornadoes can boast wind speeds of more than 200 miles per hour and can happen anywhere.  So, with spring and summer on the way, we’ve teamed up with Ready.gov to give you some emergency preparedness tips for tornado weather.  Being prepared for storms Although storm forecasting has come a long way, tornadoes can still occur with little warning. Being prepared before the storm is vital to being able to survive a violent twister.  Before the sirens go off, you should know your area’s tornado risk. Sign up for an Emergency Alert System or a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather radio to receive emergency alerts when they happen.  While many people joke about meteorologists, they are the first line in predicting when conditions might be right for a tornado, so be sure you have a working radio that can pick up the weather forecast if power goes out in your home or your television satellite dish stops working.  Even before the storm season, practice going into a safe place in your home, whether that is a tornado shelter or a small, interior, windowless room on the lowest level of the home.  Create a plan for communication in case the family is separated, like identifying a person out of state who everyone is instructed to call in case of storm emergencies.  Also, know the difference between a tornado watch and a tornado warning. According to NOAA, a tornado watch means the conditions are right for the formation of a twister. A tornado warning means a tornado has been sighted with an imminent threat to life and property. If a warning is issued, take action immediately and find your safe shelter.  Every school should have a tornado plan. Ensure that your child’s school has a tornado plan in place and know how to contact the school when emergencies happen.  Educate the members of your family on how to turn off utilities such as gas and electricity. If you smell gas after a tornado strikes, turn off the valve and leave the area immediately.  What you should keep in a storm shelter If you have an in-ground or in-home storm shelter, be sure it’s fully stocked in case you must spend hours (or sometimes days) in it after a tornado hits.  Fresh water (one gallon per person, per day, to last three days), snacks, phone chargers, extra blankets, flashlights, batteries and an NOAA radio are some necessities for your storm shelter.  This is important: if you have a shelter, be sure you’ve registered its location with your municipality, so they know where to look in case the shelter is covered in debris. Keep games and books in the shelter to help distract children and keep a first-aid kit handy in case of injuries or scrapes.  It’s also a good idea to keep the following items in a portable container that can be carried to your shelter or safe location. A small safe where you store important documents such as birth certificates, passports, ownership certificates, insurance policies, social security cards and more. Bottled water. Food. Non-perishable foods such as tuna and crackers, granola bars and nuts are good choices, but also include formula and baby food if there is an infant in the home. Battery powered radio, more flashlights and batteries. First-aid kit. Prescription medications. Games and books for kids. Extra clothes, closed-toed shoes, gloves. What to do if you are under a tornado warning If a tornado warning has been issued, get to a sturdy building or shelter immediately, such as a safe room, basement or windowless indoor room. Stay away from windows and doors and use your arms to protect your head and neck.  If you are on the road, do not seek shelter under an overpass or bridge. Find a building close by or, in dire situations, lie in a low, flat location. Ditches can flood during a storm, so do not seek shelter in a drainage ditch or tunnel.  Flying debris causes the most injury or death in tornadoes, so use a mattress, bike helmet or even pots and pans to protect your head.  Whatever you do, don’t panic. Calmly find your safe location, protect your head and neck and keep your weather radio close by.  What to do after a tornado strikes If your neighborhood was hit by a tornado, additional precautions are needed. Many suffer injuries from exposed debris, nails, gas leaks and more after a twister has passed through.  Keep listening to your weather radio and local authorities for updated information. If you are trapped in a home or shelter, keep your mouth covered with a wet cloth to avoid breathing in dust and impurities and bang on a pipe or wall to get attention to your location.  Because phone systems are usually down after a tornado, use your phone only for emergencies. Text messaging and social media can be used to communicate with your friends and family but be prepared for the possibility that you won’t have service.  Do not enter damaged buildings until they have been deemed safe by authorities and watch out for downed power lines or broken gas lines. Wear thick-soled, closed-toe shoes, long pants and gloves if you are in and around debris following a storm.  Remember, preparation comes first Everyone living or working in tornado-prone areas should have a weather radio inside their home or place of work, especially if you live in an area that does not have storm warning sirens. All-weather radios broadcast National Weather Service warnings and information 24 hours a day, and post-event information for all types of hazards, both natural and technological.  NOAA Weather Radios are available at electronics stores and online, and range in cost from $25 to $100 or more. It’s a sound investment to keep prepared for any kind of severe weather, not just tornadoes.  As an Oklahoman, it is wise to be prepared for seasonal storms and emergency situations that can happen at a moment’s notice. This is part two of an INTEGRIS blog series on how to prepare for emergency situations.  Stay tuned for another blog coming soon with tips on staying safe during the summer.
OSHA	https://www.osha.gov/tornado/preparedness	National	NA	English	Tornado Warning, Severe Weather Statement	Preparedness Preparedness involves a continuous process of planning, equipping, training and exercising. Planning for tornadoes requires identifying a place to take shelter, being familiar with and monitoring your community’s warning system, and establishing procedures to account for individuals in the building. Employers may need to obtain additional equipment and/or resources (e.g. Emergency Supply Kits) identified in the plan. In addition, workers need to be trained and plans need to be practiced to ensure that personnel are familiar with what to do in the event of a tornado.  Planning Identifying Shelter Locations  An underground area, such as a basement or storm cellar, provides the best protection from a tornado. If an underground shelter is unavailable, consider the following:  Seek a small interior room or hallway on the lowest floor possible Stay away from doors, windows, and outside walls Stay in the center of the room, and avoid corners because they attract debris Rooms constructed with reinforced concrete, brick or block with no windows and a heavy concrete floor or roof system overhead Avoid auditoriums, cafeterias and gymnasiums that have flat, wide-span roofs. Personnel should also be aware of what to do if caught outdoors when a tornado is threatening. Seek shelter in a basement or a sturdy building. If one is not within walking distance, try to drive in a vehicle, using a seat belt, to the nearest shelter. If flying debris is encountered while in a vehicle, there are two options: 1) staying in the vehicle with the seat belt on, keeping your head below the windows and covering it with your hands or a blanket, 2) if there is an area which is noticeable lower than the roadway, lie in that area and cover your head with your hands.  Accountability procedures  The following steps are recommended to help ensure the safety of personnel if a tornado occurs:  Warning Systems Tornado Watch - Tornadoes are likely to occur in the watch area. Be ready to act quickly and take shelter, and check supply kits. Monitor radio and television stations for more information.  Tornado Warning - Imminent threat - A tornado has been sighted in the area or has been indicated by radar. Take shelter immediately.  Your local emergency management office can provide information about your community’s tornado warning system.  Develop a system for knowing who is in the building in the event of an emergency Establish an alarm system to warn workers Test systems frequently Develop plans to communicate warnings to personnel with disabilities or who do not speak English Account for workers, visitors, and customers as they arrive in the shelter Use a prepared roster or checklist Take a head count Assign specific duties to workers in advance; create checklists for each specific responsibility. Designate and train workers alternates in case the assigned person is not there or is injured Some businesses are required to have an Emergency Action Plan meeting the requirements under 29 CFR 1910.38, see Evacuation Plans and Procedures eTool for more information. Though Emergency Action Plans primarily involve evacuations, emergency planning for tornadoes involve identifying safe places of refuge for workers to go to in the event of tornadoes.  Employers whose workers will be involved in emergency response operations for releases of, or substantial threats of releases of, hazardous substances regardless of the location of the hazard must comply with OSHA’s Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standard, 29 CFR 1910.120. This may include emergency response following an earthquake. Instruction CPL 02-02-073 describes OSHA enforcement procedures under the relevant provisions of the HAZWOPER standard.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated a standard applying OSHA’s HAZWOPER standard to state and local government workers in states where there is no OSHA-approved State Plan. See 40 CFR Part 311.  OSHA’s HAZWOPER Safety and Health Topics page explains requirements of the OSHA HAZWOPER standard, including required worker training.  Equipping Get emergency supply kits and keep them in shelter locations Basic Disaster Supplies Kit Learn more about NOAA Weather Radio. Training and Exercises Ensure that all workers know what to do in case of an emergency. Practice shelter-in-place plans on a regular basis. Update plans and procedures based on lessons learned from exercises. For more information, see the preparedness guide developed by NOAA, FEMA and the American Red Cross.

Survive-a-Storm Shelters	https://survive-a-storm.com/shelters/oklahoma/	Oklahoma	NA	English	Tornado Warning, Severe Weather Statement	Oklahoma, located in "Tornado Alley," has experienced more tornados than any other state in the US. Despite the risks, Oklahoma has implemented new technologies and strategies to improve tornado warnings and preparedness, including a network of tornado sirens and improved radar systems. Here are some more facts about tornadoes in Oklahoma.  The deadliest tornado in Oklahoma history occurred on May 3, 1999, when an EF5 tornado hit the Oklahoma City metro area and killed 36 people. Oklahoma has experienced over 4,000 tornadoes since 1950, which is more than any other state in the United States. The most active month for tornadoes in Oklahoma is May, with an average of 22 tornadoes occurring during that month. The largest tornado outbreak in Oklahoma history occurred in May 2013, when 56 tornadoes touched down in the state over a period of three days. The fastest recorded tornado wind speed in Oklahoma was 302 mph and occurred in 1999. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area has been hit by more tornadoes than any other metropolitan area in the United States. The first recorded tornado in Oklahoma occurred on April 26, 1893, in the northwestern part of the state. The deadliest tornado outbreak in Oklahoma history occurred on April 9, 1947, when 181 people were killed by tornadoes that touched down across the state.  Preparing for Tornadoes in Oklahoma Tornadoes are a frequent and devastating natural occurrence in Oklahoma, making tornado preparation an essential aspect of life in the state. It is crucial for residents to take the necessary steps to prepare for these events and to understand the potential dangers associated with tornadoes.  Tornadoes can strike suddenly, leaving little time for people to react. By having a plan in place and being prepared, residents can increase their chances of survival and minimize the potential damage caused by the tornado.  Proper preparation can also help to minimize the economic impact of tornadoes. Tornadoes can cause extensive damage to buildings, homes, and infrastructure, resulting in significant financial losses for individuals and businesses. By taking the necessary precautions, such as securing buildings and developing evacuation plans, the potential for damage can be reduced, minimizing the economic impact of these events.  Tornado preparation is important for ensuring that emergency services are not overwhelmed during a tornado event. By being prepared, individuals can take measures to protect themselves and their families, reducing the number of people who require assistance from emergency services. This, in turn, allows emergency services to focus on those who are most in need of their help and resources.  Preparation is an ongoing process that involves education and awareness. By understanding the risks associated with tornadoes and taking the necessary steps to prepare, individuals can help to build a safer and more resilient community. This includes staying informed about tornado warnings and evacuation orders, maintaining emergency supplies, and participating in drills and training exercises.  Tornado Shelters in Oklahoma In Oklahoma, public tornado shelters are typically managed by local authorities. These shelters may be located in government buildings, community centers, schools, or other public buildings.  To find public tornado shelters in your area, you can start by contacting your local county emergency management office or city government office. They may be able to provide you with information on the location of public tornado shelters and the procedures for accessing them during a tornado event.  The American Red Cross in Oklahoma often has information about the location of public tornado shelters and may be able to provide you with other resources related to tornado preparedness and response.  Additionally, local news sources such as TV and radio stations may provide information on the location of public tornado shelters during severe weather events. Some counties also have alert systems that notify residents of severe weather events and the location of public shelters.  It is important to note that not all areas in Oklahoma have public tornado shelters, and some shelters may have limited capacity or require advance registration. It may also be difficult to get to a shelter from your home. For this reason, part of your tornado preparation plan may include installing a tornado shelter in your home or business, if not already equipped.   Safety Tips for Oklahoma Tornadoes With Oklahoma experiencing more tornadoes than any other state in the US, it's important to keep a few tips in mind for safety:   Stay up-to-date on the latest weather reports and watch for tornado warnings issued by the National Weather Service. It is important to have multiple sources of information in case one fails. StormWarn is also a great localized warning system for Oklahomans that will send you an alert when it is time to take in your home's immediate area.  Develop a tornado plan for your home and workplace, and make sure everyone in your household or workplace knows what to do in case of a tornado. Identify safe locations where you can take shelter, such as a basement, storm cellar, or interior room on the lowest level of the building. Practice tornado drills with your family or coworkers to ensure that everyone knows what to do in an emergency. Conduct drills at different times of the day or night to prepare for unexpected situations. Keep an emergency kit on hand that includes food, water, a first aid kit, and other essentials that can sustain you and your family for a few hours, or overnight. Take steps to secure your property, such as reinforcing windows and doors, securing outdoor items, and trimming trees and branches that may fall during a storm. If a tornado warning is issued for your area, stay indoors and take shelter in a safe location. If you are sheltering in an interior area of your home, avoid windows, and if possible, cover yourself with blankets, pillows, or a mattress for added protection. (But, the safest plan is a storm shelter.) If you live in a mobile home, evacuate and seek shelter in a sturdy building or designated storm shelter. Avoid driving or walking through floodwaters, as they can be deeper and more dangerous than they appear. Make sure children and pets are kept safe during a tornado event and know where to go in case of an emergency. Check on your neighbors, particularly those who may need assistance during an emergency, such as the elderly or those with disabilities. oklahomatornadoes 0003 2023okctornadodamage Frequently Asked Questions About Tornadoes in Oklahoma Q. What types of tornado shelters are available in Oklahoma? A: There are many different types of shelters available to you if you live in Oklahoma, including some community shelters, but you will need to do some research, based on where you live. Start by contacting one of the four chapters of the American Red Cross in Oklahoma, or your area's emergency management department. Not all cities offer public community shelters, but several businesses do, depending on the location.  If you own a home, it's a great idea to consider installing your own tornado shelter. There are several kinds to consider in both above-ground and underground varieties, depending on a few factors where you live. (It's best to consult an expert.) The many kinds of tornado shelters will vary in terms of safety features and accessibility.  Q: What is the difference between a public and private tornado shelter in Oklahoma? A: Public tornado shelters are managed by local authorities and are open to the community during severe weather events. Private tornado shelters are built for personal use, typically within a home or on private property, and are not open to the public. Some larger businesses also manage shelters which they open to the public during tornado activity.   Q: How can I find the nearest tornado shelter to my home or workplace in Oklahoma? A: You can find the nearest tornado shelter by checking local government websites, contacting your city or county emergency management office, or using online resources and mapping tools.  Q: Can I bring my pets to a tornado shelter in Oklahoma, or are there designated shelters for pets during severe weather events? A: Policies for pets in tornado shelters vary by location. Some shelters may allow pets, while others may have designated pet-friendly shelters. Check with the shelter's owner for specific guidelines. If pets are a major concern during a storm, it's probably best to purchase your own tornado shelter to ensure your furry loved ones are safe.   Q: Are tornado shelters in Oklahoma wheelchair accessible, and what accommodations are available for individuals with disabilities? A: If a tornado shelter were installed by a city, country or state government office, then it would be required by law to be handicap accessible. But unfortunately, not all cities have public tornado shelters. If you've found a shelter in your area, it's best to check with them to ask about accessibility.   Q: How do I prepare for a tornado in Oklahoma? What should I bring to the shelter with me? A: Prepare by having an emergency kit ready. Include water, non-perishable food, medications, flashlights, and a battery-powered radio. Remember that tornadoes are typically over quickly, compared to other emergencies, so you probably only need enough supplies on harnd for a few hours, overnight at the most. Familiarize yourself with the shelter's location and access protocol. If you have a home tornado shelter consider storing these items inside the shelter to avoid last minute confusion.   Q: How often are tornado shelters in Oklahoma inspected and maintained to ensure their safety and effectiveness? A: The frequency of inspection and maintenance varies depending on the shelter type and local regulations. Generally, tornado shelters should be inspected and maintained regularly to ensure their safety and effectiveness.
Moore, OK city website	https://www.cityofmoore.com/departments/emergency-management/emergency-preparedness-resources	Oklahoma	NA	English	Tornado Warning, Severe Weather Statement, Flood Warning	The weather in Moore is normally delightful – BUT – we do occasionally witness the power and ferocity of severe thunderstorms. What should you do when severe weather threatens, what shouldn’t you do, and what do our authorities do.  Weather Threats Thunderstorms can threaten your personal safety in a number of different means. The primary weather threats, ranked by number of fatalities annually, are:  Flash Flooding; Lightning; Tornadoes; Straight-line winds; Hail It is also useful to know the physical threats that occur during a tornado and severe straight-line wind events. These include (from most likely to least likely):  Being penetrated by flying debris propelled by winds, which can be in excess of 100 mph; Being crushed under something heavy; Being lifted and thrown by the wind Watches and Warnings These factors are why it is important to cover yourself with a heavy coat or blanket (in an attempt to stop/slow the debris), and to take shelter under something sturdy, such as a heavy desk.  Weather WATCH A WATCH is issued when expert convective storm meteorologists at the Storms Prediction Center in Norman determine that severe thunderstorms or tornadoes are possible. These watches are generally issued for large areas, such as all of western Oklahoma. A WATCH means to continue normal activities, but to keep an eye to the sky. As with the warnings as listed below, severe weather watches are issued for potential tornado, severe thunderstorm, and flash flood events.  Weather WARNING A WARNING is issued by meteorologists at local weather service offices when severe weather or tornadoes are actually occurring. Warnings are generally issued for very small areas, such as a single county or groups of 2-3 counties. When a WARNING is issued, you should TAKE COVER IMMEDIATELY if you are in the path of the storm! Three types of WARNINGS are issued for severe storms: TORNADO WARNINGS, when tornado conditions have actually been observed or are imminent based upon radar information; SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNINGS, where storms are producing straight line winds of 57 mph or greater, hail 1” diameter or greater, and/or are capable of producing a tornado; FLASH FLOOD WARNINGS, where streams, creeks, or urban waterways are flooding or will be very soon. In Moore, our Emergency Management staff works closely with the meteorologists at the National Weather Service Forecast Office located in Norman. NWS personnel will generate warnings based upon not only radar information, but also information from our Moore severe weather spotters that are in the field. Therefore, when a warning is issued for Cleveland County, our EOC staff normally have played a part in the decision process. If our EOC staff determine that tornadic conditions will directly affect Moore, we will activate our local warning system, consisting of an outdoor warning siren system and a cable television interrupt. The NWS office will be triggering the alarm on NOAA Weather Radio, and local media will be broadcasting the warning as well.  Things Not to Do During severe weather warnings, there are a few things NOT to do: First, don’t go outside or to a window to look around. Instead, take shelter immediately and gather information on the storms via a portable battery powered NOAA Weather Radio, commercial broadcast radio or television. Don’t call 9-1-1 or the Police/Fire Departments for information on the storms or where to shelter. Know ahead of time where to take shelter, and as noted above, get information on the weather via radio or TV. 9-1-1 should never be called unless you have an emergency, and our Communications, Emergency Management, Police, and Fire personnel are typically extremely busy during severe weather events. Don’t take a shower or bath, use a regular wireline telephone, or use a computer connected to a modem. Should lightning strike nearby, the electrical current could travel through the telephone line or the plumbing to you. Finally, don’t take shelter under a highway bridge. Click on the next page for more information on this.  Tornado Safety Tornadoes are the most violent atmospheric phenomenon on the planet. Winds of 200-300 mph can occur with the most violent tornadoes. If a tornado was approaching, would you know what to do? The following are instructions on what to do when a tornado warning has been issued for your area or whenever a tornado threatens.  In homes or small buildings, go to the basement (if available) or to an interior room on the lowest floor, such as a closet or bathroom. Wrap yourself in overcoats or blankets to protect yourself from flying debris.  In schools, hospitals, factories or shopping centers, go to interior rooms and halls on the lowest floor. Stay away from glass enclosed places or areas with wide-span roofs such as auditoriums and warehouses. Crouch down and cover your head.  In high rise buildings, go to interior small rooms or halls. Stay away from exterior walls or glassy areas.  In cars or mobile homes, abandon them immediately!! Most deaths occur in cars and mobile homes. If you are in either of those locations, leave them and go to a substantial structure or designated tornado shelter. If in your car, remember that highway bridges are not designed as tornado shelters, and make for very poor shelter.  If no suitable structure is nearby, lie flat in the nearest ditch or depression and use your hands to cover your head.  Actual tornadoes – on the ground, causing damage – do NOT occur as frequently in Moore as one might think. According to the National Weather Service storm database for Cleveland County, about a dozen tornadoes have struck Moore or the immediate area in the past 50 years. Of these, only two have been significant in terms of destruction and fatalities: an F3 tornado that struck on November 19, 1973; and an extremely violent F5 tornado that devastated the northwestern part of Moore on May 3, 1999. However from these dozen events, there are only 7 known fatalities (five of which occurred during the 5/3/99 event).  Lightning Safety Do you know what to do if you are caught in the open during a thunderstorm or you feel tingling or your hair standing on end? Lightning can strike up to several miles away from the thunderstorm. When inside:  Avoid using the telephone (except for emergencies) or other electrical appliances.  Do not take a bath or shower.  If caught outdoors:  Go to a safe shelter, such as inside a sturdy building, immediately! A pickup truck or hard top automobile with the windows up can also offer fair protection. Most open park shelters and pavilions do NOT offer good protection.  If you are boating or swimming, get out of the water immediately and move to a safe shelter away from the water!  If you are in a wooded area, seek shelter under a thick growth of relatively small trees.  If you feel your hair standing on end, squat with your head between your knees. Do not lie flat!  Avoid isolated trees or other tall objects, bodies of water, sheds, fences, convertible automobiles, tractors and motorcycles.  Flash Flood Safety Flash floods develop quickly.  They can occur anywhere, along rivers or creeks, in low water crossings or in a dry stream bed. They can occur during any month and at any time during the day. In fact, flash floods often occur at night when it is difficult to find an escape route. Flash floods can be deceptive. Flood waters are likely deeper and moving faster than you think.  WHEN DRIVING Avoid low water crossings. Use alternate routes to avoid flood prone areas. Leave your vehicle immediately if it stalls in flood waters. Move to higher ground if you can do so safely. Most cars and light trucks will begin to float in as little as 1 to 2 feet of water. ACT QUICKLY Rising waters make vehicle doors difficult if not impossible to open.  IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE Everyone, especially children, should stay away from flooded creeks, streams or drainage ditches.  Swiftly flowing water can quickly sweep away even the strongest swimmers.  Soggy banks can collapse, dumping you into flood waters. Flash Floods develop quickly.  They can occur anywhere, along rivers or creeks, in low water crossings or in a dry stream bed.  They can occur during any month and at any time during the day. In fact, flash floods often occur at night when it is difficult to find an escape route.  Flash floods can be deceptive. Flood waters are likely deeper and moving faster than you think.
Red Cross	https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/volcano.html	National	NA	English	Volcano Warning	Volcano Preparedness Learn about the hazards of an erupting volcano and how to keep your family safe.  Need Help Now? If you are in immediate need of help, please contact your local Red Cross » or find an open shelter ».  A volcano is an opening in the Earth’s crust that allows molten rock, gases, and debris to escape to the surface. Volcanic eruptions can kill people and destroy property.  Eruptions fall into two broad types:     Explosive eruptions include widespread ashfall, the release of dangerous hot gases, volcanic rocks, and mud. Quiet eruptions include lava flows that can ignite fires and produce harmful gas clouds.    Volcanoes have the potential to cause great harm and destruction. But we can take action to prepare. Prepare now to protect yourself, your loved ones, and your home.  What Should You Do Before a Volcano Eruption? Know Your Risk   Know if you are in an area at risk. There are many potentially active volcanoes in the US, including Alaska, California, Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, and the islands of the Pacific. Reach out to your local emergency management office to learn about your community’s risk of volcanoes.  Plan to Stay Connected   Sign up for local government emergency alerts. Plan to listen to local emergency information and follow instructions from local officials. The US Geological Survey (USGS) uses a nationwide volcano alert system to describe volcanic conditions. Local officials closely monitor USGS information, and issue guidance to keep community members safe. Create a support team to help you prepare and stay safe. Plan how you can help each other. Plan to reconnect with loved ones if you are separated. Carry contact cards. Set up a group text message. Designate an out-of-town contact who can help your household reconnect. It may be easier to reach people outside the affected area. Plan to Stay Safe   Understand how your community will respond to an eruption. Your local government has plans to help protect people. Local officials may advise you to leave the area or take shelter where you are. Learn about your community’s plan, and then make plans with your household. Have an evacuation plan. The only way to stay safe from a blast, flying debris, hot gases, fast-moving mud, rock, water (known as lahars) and lava flow is to evacuate if local officials advise. Know where you will go, how you will get there, and where you will stay. Plan for your pets and livestock. Follow recommended routes. Have a plan to protect your health from ash, smog, and glass. Officials may advise you to stay inside to protect yourself from ash, debris, volcanic smog (vog) which is a toxic air pollutant, and volcanic glass. These can harm your health, especially your lungs, eyes, and skin. Plan to limit your time outdoors. Know how to close windows and doors. Use an indoor air cleaner. Short-term use of N95 masks can help protect against volcanic ash but not gases. Plan to avoid driving because ash can reduce visibility, make surfaces slippery, and clog car engines. If your indoor area continues to have poor air quality, move to a safer place. Plan to avoid river valleys. Lahars can rush down valleys and streams, destroying anything is their path. Gather Emergency Supplies   Gather food, water, and medicine. Organize supplies into a Go-Kit and a Stay-at-Home Kit: Go-Kit: at least three days of supplies that you can carry with you. Include backup batteries and chargers for your devices (cell phone, CPAP, wheelchair, etc.) Stay-at-Home Kit: at least two weeks of supplies. Have N95 respirators, long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and goggles. Drinking water may be contaminated, have at least one gallon of water per person per day. Have a 1-month supply of medication in a child-proof container and medical supplies or equipment. Keep personal, financial, and medical records safe and easy to access (hard copies or securely backed up). Consider keeping a list of your medications and dosages on a small card to carry with you.  What Should You Do During a Volcanic Eruption? Stay Informed   Listen carefully to local emergency information. Depending on your location, officials may advise you to evacuate or stay indoors. Follow this guidance. What Should You Do After a Volcanic Eruption? Prevent Injuries   If you evacuated, wait until officials say it is safe before you return home. If you stayed inside, wait until officials say it is safe to go outside. Be careful, as ash makes surfaces slippery. Protect Your Health   Volcanic ash can make drinking water unsafe. Check with your local health department about drinking water safety. When in doubt, throw it out! Throw out food exposed to ash, heat, smoke, fumes, or chemicals. Follow local public health guidance for ash cleanup. Wear protective equipment (an N95 respirator, gloves, long-sleeve shirts, long pants, shoes, socks, and goggles). N95 respirators do not filter toxic gases and vapors. Prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. Only use generators, grills, and camp stoves outdoors and away from windows. Take Care of Yourself   It’s normal to have a lot of bad feelings, stress or anxiety. Eat healthy food and get enough sleep to help you deal with stress. You can contact the Disaster Distress Helpline for free if you need to talk to someone. Call or text 1-800-985-5990.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/volcanoes/during.html	National	1/25/2022	English	Volcano Warning	Key Facts About Protecting Yourself During a Volcanic Eruption You can do many things to protect yourself and your family from the dangers a volcanic eruption can cause. The best way to do protect yourself and your family is to follow the advice of local officials. Local authorities will provide you with information on how to prepare for a volcanic eruption, and if necessary, on how to evacuate (leave the area) or take shelter where you are.  If a lahar, pyroclastic flow, or lava flow is headed toward you Leave the area immediately. If you are warned to evacuate because an eruption is imminent, evacuate. On This Page If lava flow is headed toward you If you are indoors If you are outdoors Protecting against ashfall If you can drive rather than walk, use your vehicle to evacuate. When driving keep doors and windows closed, drive across the path of danger if you can or away from the danger if you can not, and watch for unusual hazards in the road. If you are indoors Close all windows, doors, and fireplace or woodstove dampers. Turn off all fans and heating and air conditioning systems. Bring pets and livestock into closed shelters. Top of Page If you are outdoors Seek shelter indoors. If caught in a rockfall, roll into a ball to protect your head. If near a stream or river, be aware of rising water and possible mudflows in low-lying areas. Move up-slope as quickly as possible. Seek care for burns right away. Immediate care can be life saving. If your eyes, nose, and throat become irritated from volcanic gases and fumes, move away from the area immediately. Your symptoms should go away when you are no longer in contact with the gases or fumes. If the symptoms continue, consult your doctor. Protecting yourself during ashfall Photo of respiratory mask. Stay inside, if possible, with windows and doors closed. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Use goggles to protect your eyes.If ash is continually falling, you may not be able to shelter indoors for more than a few hours, because the weight of the ash could collapse the roof of your building and block air intakes into the building. Listen to authorities for advice on leaving the area when ashfall lasts more than a few hours. Exposure to ash can harm your health, particularly the respiratory (breathing) tract. To protect yourself while you are outdoors or while you are cleaning up ash that has gotten indoors, a disposable particulate respirator (also known as an “air purifying respirator”) may be considered. An N-95 respirator is the most common type of disposable particulate respirator and can be purchased at businesses such as hardware stores. It is important to follow directions for proper use of this respirator. For more information, see NIOSH-Approved Disposable Particulate Respirators (Filtering Facepieces) . If you don’t have a particulate respirator, you can protect yourself by using a nuisance dust mask as a last resort, but you should stay outdoors for only short periods while dust is falling. Nuisance dust masks can provide comfort and relief from exposure to relatively non-hazardous contaminants such as pollen, but they do not offer as much protection as a particulate respirator. Cleanup or emergency workers may need a different type of breathing protection based on their work activity. Note that disposable particulate respirators do not filter toxic gases and vapors. Keep your car or truck engine switched off. Avoid driving in heavy ashfall. Driving will stir up ash that can clog engines and stall vehicles. If you do have to drive, keep the car windows up and do not operate the air conditioning system. Operating the air conditioning system will bring in outside air and ash.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	https://www.cdc.gov/es/disasters/volcanoes/during.html	National	1/25/2022	Spanish	Volcano Warning	Datos importantes sobre su protección durante una erupción volcánica Usted puede hacer muchas cosas para protegerse y proteger a su familia de los peligros que una erupción volcánica puede causar. La mejor manera de protegerse y proteger a su familia es seguir los consejos de las autoridades locales. Las autoridades locales le darán información sobre cómo prepararse para una erupción volcánica y, si es necesario, le indicarán cómo evacuar (abandonar la zona) o refugiarse en el lugar.  Si una avalancha de lodo, derrame piroclástico o derrame de lava se dirigen hacia usted Abandone inmediatamente el área. Si se le advierte que evacúe porque una erupción es inminente, evacúe. On This Page Si un derrame de lava se dirige hacia usted Si se encuentra en el interior de un lugar Si se encuentra al aire libre Protección contra la lluvia de ceniza Si puede conducir en lugar de caminar, use su vehículo para evacuar la zona. Mientras esté conduciendo, mantenga cerradas las puertas y ventanas; si puede, viaje atravesando la ruta de peligro, o si no puede, aléjese del peligro y manténgase alerta a los peligros inusuales en la carretera. Si se encuentra en el interior de un lugar Cierre todas las ventanas, puertas, y el tiro de chimeneas o estufas a leña. Apague todos los ventiladores y sistemas de calefacción y de aire acondicionado. Lleve a las mascotas y los animales de cría a refugios cerrados. Inicio de la página Si se encuentra en el exterior Busque refugio en interiores. Si queda atrapado en un derrumbe de rocas, hágase un ovillo para protegerse la cabeza. Si se encuentra cerca de un arroyo o río, esté atento a inundaciones y posibles aludes de barro en las áreas bajas. Vaya a terrenos más elevados lo antes posible. Busque atención para las quemaduras de inmediato. La atención inmediata puede salvar vidas. Si se le irritan los ojos, la nariz y la garganta por los gases y emanaciones volcánicos, aléjese del área de inmediato. Es probable que los síntomas desaparezcan cuando ya no esté en contacto con los gases o vapores. Si los síntomas continúan, hable con su médico. Inicio de la página Protéjase durante las lluvias de ceniza Foto de una máscara respiratoria. Permanezca en el interior, si es posible, con las ventanas y puertas cerradas. Use camisas de manga larga y pantalones largos. Use gafas para protegerse los ojos. Si cae continuamente ceniza, es posible que no pueda protegerse en el interior por más de cuatro horas, porque el peso de la ceniza podría colapsar el techo y bloquear las entradas de aire del edificio. Escuche el consejo de las autoridades sobre cómo salir del área cuando la lluvia de ceniza dure más de unas pocas horas. La exposición a las cenizas puede dañar su salud, en particular las vías respiratorias. Para protegerse cuando se encuentre al aire libre o mientras limpie la ceniza que ha entrado en interiores, podría considerar usar un respirador desechable para partículas (también conocido como “respirador purificador de aire”). El respirador N-95 es el tipo más común de respiradores desechables para partículas, y se puede comprar en tiendas como ferreterías. Es importante seguir las instrucciones para utilizar este respirador de manera adecuada. Para obtener más información, consulte Respiradores desechables con pieza filtrante de partículas aprobados por NIOSH (En Inglés). Si no tiene un respirador para partículas, puede protegerse con una mascarilla común para el polvo como último recurso, pero debe permanecer en el interior solo por periodos breves mientras cae el polvo. Las mascarillas comunes para el polvo son cómodas y protegen contra la exposición a contaminantes relativamente no peligrosos como el polen, pero no ofrecen tanta protección como un respirador para partículas. Los trabajadores de limpieza o de emergencias podrían necesitar otro tipo de protección respiratoria, dependiendo de su actividad laboral. Tenga en cuenta que los respiradores para partículas no filtran los gases y los vapores tóxicos. Mantenga apagado el motor de su automóvil o camioneta. Evite conducir en lluvias de ceniza muy copiosas. Conducir mueve las cenizas, y estas pueden atascar motores y ahogar vehículos. Si tiene que conducir, mantenga cerradas las puertas y no encienda el sistema de aire acondicionado. Si enciende el sistema de aire acondicionado ingresarán el aire y las cenizas del exterior.

During a volcanic eruption, lava and other debris can flow at speeds of up to 100 mph, destroying everything in their path. Volcanic ash can travel hundreds of miles and cause severe health problems.  feature_mini img There are 161 potentially active volcanoes in the United States. Alaska, Hawaii, California, Washington and Oregon have the largest number of active volcanoes, but other states and territories also have active volcanoes.  A volcanic eruption can:  Contaminate water supplies. Damage machinery. Reduce visibility through smog and harmful gases that may threaten low-lying areas. Make it hard to breathe and irritate the skin, eyes, nose and throat. IF YOU ARE UNDER A VOLCANO WARNING:  Listen for emergency information and alerts. Follow evacuation or shelter orders. If advised to evacuate, do so early. Reduce your ash exposure by doing the following: Limit your time outdoors and use a dust mask or cloth mask as a last resort if you must be outside. Avoid areas downwind and river valleys downstream of the volcano. Take temporary shelter from volcanic ash in the location where you are. Cover ventilation openings and seal doors and windows. Avoid driving in heavy ash. If you must drive, keep the windows up and do not use the air conditioning system. Do not get on your roof to remove ash. Stay indoors until authorities say it is safe to go outside. Prepare NOW Image illustration of an emergency supply kit including water, cleaning supplies, a book, canned food and a flashlight. Know your area’s risk from volcanic eruption. Ask local emergency management for evacuation and shelter plans, and for potential means of protection from ash. Learn about community warning systems by signing up for a free service called the Volcano Notification Service (VNS) that sends notifications about volcanic activity. Get necessary supplies in advance, including nonperishable foods, cleaning supplies and water for several days, in case you have to evacuate immediately or if services are cut off. Keep in mind each person’s specific needs, including medication. Do not forget pets’ needs for medication and food. Consult your doctor if you have existing respiratory difficulties. Practice a communication and evacuation plan with everyone in your family. Have a plan for pets and livestock. Have a shelter-in-place plan if your biggest risk is from ash. Keep important documents in a safe place. Create password-protected digital copies. Find out what your homeowner’s insurance policy will cover when a volcano erupts. Survive DURING Image a volcano evacuation map Listen to alerts. The Volcano Notification Service provides up-to-date information about eruptions. Follow evacuation orders from local authorities. Evacuate early. Avoid areas downwind, and river valleys downstream, of the volcano. Rubble and ash will be carried by wind and gravity. Take temporary shelter from volcanic ash in the location where you are, if you have enough supplies. Cover ventilation openings and seal doors and windows. If outside, protect yourself from falling ash that can irritate skin and injure breathing passages, eyes and open wounds. Use a well-fitting, certified face mask, such as an N95. Avoid driving in heavy ash fall. Be Safe AFTER Image Hand holding a phone showing text messages Listen to authorities to find out when it is safe to return after an eruption. Stay indoors until authorities say it is safe to go outside. Send text messages or use social media to reach out to family and friends. Phone systems often are busy after a disaster. Only make emergency calls. Avoid driving in heavy ash. Driving will stir up volcanic ash that can clog engines and stall vehicles. Avoid contact with ash if you have any breathing problems. People with asthma and/or other lung conditions should take precaution in areas with poor air quality, as it can worsen symptoms. Do not get on your roof to remove ash unless you have guidance or training. If you have to remove ash, then be very careful as ash makes surfaces slippery. Be careful not to contribute additional weight to an overloaded roof. Wear protective clothing and a mask when cleaning up. Children should not help with cleanup efforts.

Volcanic unrest and eruptions will be reported to the public through the Volcano Hazards Program websites and by the media. Volcano Evacuation Route sign along a roadway in Washington State. ... Volcano Evacuation Route sign along a roadway in Washington State. Volcanic unrest is defined as the period of time when a volcano is showing unusual activity or is erupting. Unrest may last for months to years. During volcanic unrest, pay close attention to emergency plans and recommendations from officials. How YOU prepare will depend upon your location. You might be asked to shelter in place, or to evacuate. That is why it is important for residents and visitors to know their location relative to hazard zones. View the CVO Simplified Hazards Maps to learn more about hazard zones on volcanoes you live near or may visit.  When an Eruption is Underway Follow instructions for closures and evacuations. It might save your life. If you are in a lahar hazard zone and become aware of an oncoming lahar, get to high ground and then shelter in place. If your city or town has signed evacuation routes, follow them. If you are safe from lahars and at risk from ash fall hazards, shelter in place. Officials will update hazard zones and disseminate new information as the eruption develops. Watch and/or listen for additional information about emergency procedures. Do your part to remain safe, and help others in need.   If you are ON a volcano during an eruption: Move AWAY from hazard zones to improve your chances for safety. You may be exposed to falling ash and volcanic rocks (tephra), lava flows, lahars, toxic volcanic gases, and avalanches of hot rock and gas (pyroclastic flows). In confined spaces (caves or hollows) on the volcano, volcanic gases can concentrate and be very hazardous. Your route to safety might be cut off by lahars (volcanic mudflows). If lahars ARE a threat, STAY OFF VALLEY FLOORS AND OUT OF LOW-LYING AREAS. Pay attention to closure signs; they can save your life.   If you are NEAR, DOWNSTREAM or DOWNWIND of a volcano during an eruption: You may be at risk from LAHARS (volcanic mudflows).  Stay out of valleys and low lying areas that lead from the mountain. Consult the simplified hazards maps to determine whether you are in a lahar hazard zone. Prepare as you would for floods. You might need to evacuate people, pets, and valuables quickly. Become familiar with evacuation routes in your community. Listen carefully to official reports via emergency broadcasts, NOAA weather radio, or local notification systems such as 'reverse 911' or sirens. If officials detect a lahar seek high ground off the valley floor as quickly as possible, such as moving up a hillside. Then, shelter in place. You may be at risk from VOLCANIC ASH FALL.  Ash falling in city of Yakima: Mt. St. Helens, USA, May 18, 1980 Sources/Usage: Public Domain. Visit Media to see details. Ash falling in the city of Yakima during eruption of Mt. St. Helens, USA, May 18, 1981 (Public domain.) Minimize your exposure to ash – improve chances for safety by providing shelter for people, pets, livestock, and machinery. Listen for up to date reports – ash fall might be a significant hazard or only a nuisance, depending upon eruption size, style, and duration. Advice for dealing with ash fall is similar to advice for dealing with dust storms. Tiny abrasive ash particles are easily inhaled and harmful; they can enter all but the most tightly sealed buildings and machinery. Ash particles can be small enough (less than 10 microns – similar to a dust particle) to be inhaled deeply into the lungs. People with existing respiratory difficulties have greater health risks. Keep extra medication and oxygen for people with existing respiratory difficulties. Carefully seal machinery with moving parts that may be exposed to ash. Adjust your lifestyle so that you can live safely and relatively comfortably with volcanic ash. DO NOT DRIVE, unless absolutely necessary; ash can damage the engine, filters, and exterior of your vehicle, and driving on ash-slickened roads with reduced visibility can be hazardous. Reduce driving speed. Extensive ash fall can cause power failures and disturb water, transportation, and communication systems. Wind and human activity can stir up fallen ash for weeks to years causing long-term disruption. Have survival and clean-up resources on hand such as dust masks, extra medications, plastic sheeting, and heavy-duty tape, so that you can live safely and with reasonable comfort during these interruptions. Avoid cleanup until ash has stopped falling. However, in some situations, immediate action may be required to prevent damage or loss of function to the building. Use extreme caution when cleaning to avoid falling from the structure you are cleaning - this is a major cause of causalities.   Many more details about volcanic ash can be found at the Volcanic Ash Website.
State Farm	https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/residence/volcano-safety-tips-and-precautions	National	NA	English	Volcano Warning	Volcano safety tips If you live within 20 miles of a volcano, you'll want to know how your family can prepare and respond to an eruption.  Assess your volcano risk About 161 volcanoes are active in the United States and territories. Alaska, Hawaii, California, Washington and Oregon have the highest number of active volcanoes. Learn about eruption risks in your area by visiting the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Volcano Hazards Program, which posts up-to-date information about volcanic activity, including a color-coded risk assessment system for individual volcanoes.  How can you prepare for a volcanic eruption? Good volcano safety planning begins before an eruption actually occurs. Help prepare your family by creating a disaster preparedness plan that includes a disaster survival kit and an evacuation plan. Airborne and accumulated ash is a major volcano hazard, so be sure to include goggles and disposable breathing masks in your disaster kit. Also, the hot gases and debris from an eruption can increase the risk of fire, so it's especially important to install and maintain smoke alarms and fire extinguishers in homes within the 20-mile danger zone. Help keep you and your family safe from a volcano eruption. Talk to children and elderly about volcanoes so that everyone knows what to do during a volcanic eruption. Discussing ahead of time helps reduce fear and can save the life of a family member or pet. Check out more ways how you can prepare for a volcanic eruption.  Clear the volcanic danger zone The first thing to do during an eruption is tune in to up-to-the-minute information on a battery-powered radio. Volcanoes can produce a number of quickly moving hazards including flying debris, hot gases, lava and mudslides. If authorities issue an evacuation order, collect your family and your disaster kit and leave the area immediately.  During an evacuation, try to avoid valleys and low-lying areas where flowing hazards, such as mudslides, might converge and accumulate. If there is ash buildup on the roadway, keep your speed below 35 miles per hour to avoid slipping.  Protect against volcano ash Airborne and accumulated ash can significantly impact places as far as 100 miles from an eruption. Whenever ash is present, breathe through your emergency mask or hold a damp cloth over your nose and mouth. Protect your eyes with goggles. It's also a good idea to wear long pants and a long-sleeved shirt because ash may be hot or otherwise irritate the skin.  If your home lies within an ash fallout zone, take steps to keep as much ash as possible from entering the building. This includes closing and/or blocking all exterior windows, doors, chimneys and vents. Place towels under the door and in other gaps. As an added precaution, you may want to cover interior items such as furniture, appliances and sensitive electronic equipment. Cover exterior and garaged vehicles as well.  Keep in mind that volcanic ash is much more destructive than ordinary dust. Even fine ash can have a jagged structure that will scratch glass, metal and other materials. To remove dust from exterior home surfaces, use free-flowing water from a hose. Interior ash should be removed with a vacuum cleaner. For more information about volcanic ash removal, visit the USGS.  Volcano damage and insurance Examine your homeowners policy to make sure you have property coverage for the damages related to a volcano. Creating a home inventory for the items in your home can be helpful in the event of damage or loss during a volcano eruption. Learn more about volcano damage and insurance coverage or contact an insurance agent for more information. 
National Child Traumatic Stress Network	https://www.nctsn.org/what-is-child-trauma/trauma-types/disasters/windstorm-resources	National	NA	English	Wind Advisory	Definition A windstorm is a storm with high winds or violent gusts that are strong enough to cause at least some damage to trees and buildings. Windstorms usually involve wind speeds that exceed 34 mph. Damage from windstorms occurs from gusts, or short bursts of high-speed winds, as well as longer periods of stronger, sustained winds. Windstorms can take several forms, including downbursts, derechos, haboobs, and dust storms. When windstorms carry fine particles, as in a dust storm, they can reduce visibility quickly and may lead to accidents and massive car and truck pile-ups. Dangerous wind gusts are very difficult to predict and can occur without warning, so thunderstorm or dust storm warnings may be the only warning that they might occur.  Before Being prepared beforehand is the best way to help children and family members stay safe after a windstorm. To improve their preparedness, families should:  Identify the safest room in their home to shelter in place. Families should plan to go to a storm cellar, basement, or the lowest building level during a severe windstorm. If there is no basement, encourage them to go to an inside room without windows, like a closet or bathroom. It is best to stay away from windows, corners, or outside walls. Understand the different weather alerts related to windstorms. Because windstorms take many forms, there are several advisories and warnings of which families should be aware. It is also important to pay attention to warnings for severe thunderstorms, as these storms may produce downbursts and derechos that usually do not have their own warnings. These alerts include: Severe Thunderstorm Watch: Issued when conditions are favorable for severe storms (wind gusts of 58 mph or more or ¾ inch diameter hail or larger). People in the watch area should monitor the sky and stay tuned to know when warnings are issued.  Severe Thunderstorm Warning: Issued when large hail and/or wind gusts of 58 mph or greater are imminent. People in the warning are should take shelter in a substantial building or in a vehicle with the windows closed. Blowing Dust Advisory: Issued when blowing dust is expected to reduce visibility to between ¼ and 1 mile, generally with winds of 25 mph or greater. People should monitor for updates and exercise caution for outdoor activities and driving. Dust Storm Warning: Issued when blowing dust is expected to reduce visibility frequently to ¼ mile or less, generally with winds of 25 mph or more. People should avoid travel in the area until the dust clears, and those with respiratory problems should prepare to stay indoors until the storm fully passes.  Assemble an emergency supply kit. Families should have access to enough water, food, and other emergency supplies. They should also gather copies of important documents, a radio with batteries as needed for weather updates, and supplies for pets. For a complete checklist of what to include, review the family preparedness plan. Make a family communication plan. Keep important contact information easily accessible and know who to contact if separated from one another. Babysitters and caregivers should also have this information. To develop their plan, families can fill out the preparedness wallet card.   Plan for children’s needs. Families should give children factual information about windstorms in simple terms. Parents can also include children in preparedness activities. The mobile app Help Kids Cope provides parents with ideas about how to talk with children of different developmental levels.  During Knowing what to do during a windstorm can help families feel more in control and take steps to increase their safety. Consider the following:   During a severe thunderstorm, families should:  Take shelter in a sturdy building. Families should move to their identified safe place and avoid isolated sheds or small structures in open areas. Stay away from windows and doors, and stay off porches. They shouldn’t lie on concrete floors or lean against concrete walls. Have them take their pet to the same safe place. Avoid dangerous hazards when outside. During a thunderstorm, families should avoid natural lightning rods such as a tall, isolated tree in an open area. It is also safer to avoid hilltops, open fields, the beach, or a boat on the water.  Extend emergency supplies. If there is a concern about losing power, families should fill up tubs or jugs with water and keep mobile devices charged.  During a dust storm, families should:  Take shelter immediately. If outside, families should move indoors with their pets as soon as possible. To reduce the impact of dust, cover eyes, nose, and mouth using a bandana, scarf, shirt, or hands. If having to remain outside, families should stay low and cover up.  Practice safe driving. Encourage families to pull off the roadway, turn off all car lights, set the air conditioner to recycled air, and stay in the vehicle with seatbelts buckled until the storm passes. Monitor children for respiratory issues. Symptoms of dust exposure include wheezing, shortness of breath, sore throats, flu-like aches and pains, and fatigue. Seek medical attention when it is safe if children develop any of these symptoms. To address children’s reactions during a windstorm, parents and caregivers can:  Model calm behavior. Children may mirror the reactions of adults around them and will learn ideas for how to take care of themselves from what parents and caregivers do. Provide simple but accurate information in a quiet, steady voice. Encourage comforting or distracting activities. Children may benefit from doing slow breathing to calm their bodies, having a stuffed animal or blanket to hold, or engaging in simple activities to keep distracted when sheltering inside. For additional ideas, view these handouts. Practice their own self-care. Parents and caregivers may benefit from finding opportunities to take a moment for themselves, express their feelings, acknowledge that it is a scary situation, and engage in a coping strategy. After After a windstorm, most families will adjust and be able to return to their normal routines rather quickly. Most children will demonstrate resilience. Some children may react more strongly, however, if their homes or schools experienced damage. Parents and caregivers can support children by modeling effective problem-solving, maintaining consistent daily routines, and providing accurate information about repairs and changes the family or community will need to make after the storm. Those children who have experienced a loss of a loved one or pet will need additional grief support to help them adjust.
National Weather Service	https://www.weather.gov/safety/wind	National	NA	English	Wind Advisory	Strong Wind Safety High winds can occur during a severe thunderstorm, with a strong weather system, or can flow down a mountain. When winds are sustained at 40-50 mph, isolated wind damage is possible. Widespread significant wind damage can occur with higher wind speeds. During strong thunderstorms, straight line wind speeds can exceed 100 mph. High winds can blow objects around and pose a significant threat to your safety. Understanding the risks can help you prepare for these events. If you, or someone you know, have been a victim of a high wind event, please share your story so we can prevent others from becoming a victim. Read wind survivor stories. When you write, please note that NWS has permission to use your story and, if possible, let us know the town and state you were in and the year the event took place. The National Weather Service issues a number of Watches, Warnings and other products to alert the public about high wind events.  Warning and Watches High Wind Warning: Take Action! Sustained, strong winds with even stronger gusts are happening. Seek shelter. If you are driving, keep both hands on the wheels and slow down. NWS offices issue this product based on local criteria. High Wind Watch: Be Prepared! Sustained, strong winds are possible. Secure loose outdoor items and adjust plans as necessary so you're not caught outside. NWS offices issue this product based on local criteria. Wind Advisory: Take Action! Strong winds are occurring but are not so strong as to warrant a High Wind Warning. Objects that are outdoors should be secured and caution should be taken if driving. NWS offices issue this product based on local criteria. Dust Storm Warning: Take Action! A Dust Storm Warning is issued when visibility of 1/2 mile or less due to blowing dust or sand, and wind speeds of 30 miles an hour or more Severe Thunderstorm Watch: Be Prepared! A Severe Thunderstorm Watch is issued when severe thunderstorms are possible in and near the watch area. Winds 58 mph or higher and/or hail 1inch or larger are possible in a severe thunderstorm. Secure items outdoors that may blow around in high winds. Stay informed and be ready to take action. Severe Thunderstorm Warning: Take Action!

Seek shelter inside a sturdy building, away from windows. Gale Warning: Take Action! Gale Warnings are issued for locations along the water when one or both of the following conditions is expected to begin within 36 hours and is not directly associated with a tropical cyclone: sustained winds of 34 to 47 knots (39 to 55 mph) or frequent gusts (duration of two or more hours) between 34 knots and 47 knots. Make sure your vessel is secure in port. Hurricane Force Wind Warning: Hurricane Force Wind Warnings are issued for locations along the water when one or both of the following conditions is expected to begin within 36 hours and not directly associated with a tropical cyclone: sustained winds of 64 knots or greater or frequent gusts (duration of two or more hours) of 64 knots (74 mph) or greater. Make sure your vessel is secure in port.  Before Strong Winds Trim tree branches away from your house and power lines. Secure loose gutters and shutters. Identify an interior room of your house, such as a basement or interior bathroom, that you can take shelter in during high wind warnings. If you live in a mobile home, identify a sturdy building you can go to if NWS issues a high wind or severe thunderstorm warning. Charge batteries of all essential items such as cell phones and booster packs, weather radios and power tools such as a reciprocating saw, which you might need to clear debris. Update your emergency kit and be sure to include enough food and water to last for 3 days for each person in your home. Make a list of items outside your home you will need to tie down or put away so that they don't blow away or fly through a window. When NWS issues a high wind or severe thunderstorm watch, immediately secure these items to avoid damage or injury once the wind starts picking up.  During a High Wind Event Take Shelter Immediately go inside a sturdy building during a high wind warning or severe thunderstorm warning and move to an interior room or basement. If you are in a mobile home, move to a sturdy building before the winds pick up or the storm system reaches your location. Listen to the local news or NOAA Weather Radio for updates. If Caught Outside or Driving Take shelter in your car if you are not near a sturdy building. If possible, drive to a nearby sturdy building. Otherwise, move your car to a location where it is less likely to be hit by falling trees or power lines. If no shelter is available avoid trees, power lines, and the side of the road. Keep in mind that power lines that are laying on the ground may be live. Do not go near them! Try to find a place that will block blowing or falling debris. If you are driving and aren't near a sturdy building, hold the steering wheel with both hands and slow down. Keep a distance from high profile vehicles such as trucks, buses and vehicles towing trailers. One strong gust of wind can be enough to flip one of these trailers onto its side. During a Dust Storm or Santa Ana Winds and Wildfires Get indoors. Close all windows and turn off all AC units. If driving, pull your vehicle off the pavement as far as possible, stop, turn off lights, set the emergency brake, take your foot off of the brake pedal to be sure the tail lights are not illuminated. If you can't pull off the roadway, proceed at a speed suitable for visibility, turn on lights and sound horn occasionally. Use the painted center line to help guide you. Look for a safe place to pull off the roadway. Never stop on the traveled portion of the roadway. If you are in an area subject to Santa Ana winds or wildfires, be prepared to take precautions against wildfires. Learn more at the NWS Wildfire Safety site  After a High Wind Event Do not go near downed power lines. Report downed power lines to the police. Continue to listen to the local news and NOAA Weather Radio for updates following the storm. If you lose power and are using a generator, be sure to review generator safety tips. Be careful when handling debris that may have blown into your yard.

Nevada Department of Transportation	https://www.dot.nv.gov/safety/high-wind-driving-safety-tips	Nevada	NA	English	Wind Advisory	High Wind Driving Safety Tips High winds are an often-overlooked driving danger that can cause crashes. High winds are not unusual in Nevada, and extreme caution should be used when driving a car in high winds or any type of severe weather.  High Wind Driving Safety Tips Plan ahead. Leave extra time, as your drive may take longer due to the need to drive more slowly in high winds. Always wear a seatbelt. Slow your speed to a safe driving speed and turn on headlights if needed to account for potentially lower visibility created by blowing dust, sand, snow or rain. Keep your hands firmly on the wheel. Make steering corrections when driving from wind-protected areas to unprotected areas. The wind may suddenly move your car when traveling from a protected to unprotected area. Be aware of and maintain safe distances from other vehicles near you, particularly RVs, campers, trucks, buses, or trailers being towed. These vehicles could swing out and hit your car in sudden wind gusts. Take extra care in a high-profile vehicle such as trucks, vans, SUVs, or when towing a trailer, as these are more prone to being pushed or flipped by high winds. NDOT maintains wind warnings systems for high-profile vehicles in wind-prone areas such as the Hoover Dam bypass bridge in southern Nevada and U.S. 395/Washoe-Pleasant Valley in northern Nevada. Drivers of high profile vehicles must obey these wind warnings and prohibitions when in effect. Watch for objects that could potentially blow into the roadway. Tree limbs may break and/or other debris may come loose during strong winds. Listen to the radio for changes in weather conditions that could create more dangerous driving. If winds are severe enough to prevent safe driving, pull over into a safe parking area (the shoulder of a busy roadway is not safe) and stop, making sure you are away from trees, power lines or other tall objects that could fall onto your vehicle. When arriving at your destination, avoid parking near trees, downed power lines and buildings. In the event of downed power lines:  Never drive over downed power lines. Even if they have been knocked over by the wind, high-voltage wires may still be alive and very dangerous. Avoid anything that may be touching downed lines, including vehicles or tree branches. Report downed lines to your local utility emergency center and to the police.

OSHA	https://www.osha.gov/winter-weather/hazards	National	NA	English	Winter hazards	Hazards/Precautions Winter Weather In addition to cold stress, there are other winter weather related hazards that workers may be exposed to when performing tasks such as driving in the snow, removing snow from rooftops, and working near downed or damaged power lines.  Winter Driving Work Zone Traffic Safety Stranded in a Vehicle Shoveling Snow Using Powered Equipment like Snow Blowers Clearing Snow from Roofs and Working at Heights Preventing Slips on Snow and Ice Repairing Downed or Damaged Power Lines Working Near Downed or Damaged Power Lines Removing Downed Trees Winter Driving Although employers cannot control roadway conditions, they can promote safe driving behavior by ensuring workers: recognize the hazards of winter weather driving, for example, driving on snow/ice covered roads; are properly trained for driving in winter weather conditions; and are licensed (as applicable) for the vehicles they operate. For information about driving safely during the winter, visit OSHA's Safe Winter Driving page.  Employers should set and enforce driver safety policies. Employers should also implement an effective maintenance program for all vehicles and mechanized equipment that workers are required to operate. Crashes can be avoided. Learn more at: Motor Vehicle Safety (OSHA Safety and Health Topic’s Page).  Employers should ensure properly trained workers' inspect the following vehicle systems to determine if they are working properly:  Brakes: Brakes should provide even and balanced braking. Also check that brake fluid is at the proper level. Cooling System: Ensure a proper mixture of 50/50 antifreeze and water in the cooling system at the proper level. Electrical System: Check the ignition system and make sure that the battery is fully charged and that the connections are clean. Check that the alternator belt is in good condition with proper tension. Engine: Inspect all engine systems. Exhaust System: Check exhaust for leaks and that all clamps and hangers are snug. Tires: Check for proper tread depth and no signs of damage or uneven wear. Check for proper tire inflation. Oil: Check that oil is at proper level. Visibility Systems: Inspect all exterior lights, defrosters (windshield and rear window), and wipers. Install winter windshield wipers. An emergency kit with the following items is recommended in vehicles:  Cellphone or two-way radio Windshield ice scraper Snow brush Flashlight with extra batteries Shovel Tow chain Traction aids (bag of sand or cat litter) Emergency flares Jumper cables Snacks Water Road maps Blankets, change of clothes Work Zone Traffic Safety Workers being struck by vehicles or mobile equipment lead to many work zone fatalities or injuries annually. Drivers may skid, or lose control of their vehicles more easily when driving on snow and/or ice covered roads. It is therefore, important to properly set up work zones with the traffic controls identified by signs, cones, barrels, and barriers, to protect workers. Workers exposed to vehicular traffic should wear the appropriate high visibility vest at all times, so that they can be visible to motorists (OSHA Letter of Interpretation, dated, August 5, 2009).  Learn more at: Work Zone Traffic Safety (OSHA QuickCard™) and Highway Work Zones and Signs, Signals, and Barricades (OSHA Safety and Health Topics Page).  Stranded in a Vehicle If you are stranded in a vehicle, stay in the vehicle. Call for emergency assistance if needed, response time may be slow in severe winter weather conditions. Notify your supervisor of your situation. Do not leave the vehicle to search for assistance unless help is visible within 100 yards. You may become disoriented and get lost in blowing and drifting snow. Display a trouble sign by hanging a brightly colored cloth on the vehicle’s radio antenna and raising the hood. Turn on the vehicle's engine for about 10 minutes each hour and run the heat to keep warm. Also, turn on the vehicle's dome light when the vehicle is running as an additional signal. Beware of carbon monoxide poisoning. Keep the exhaust pipe clear of snow, and open a downwind window slightly for ventilation.  Watch for signs of frostbite and hypothermia. Do minor exercises to maintain good blood circulation in your body. Clap hands and move arms and legs occasionally. Try not to stay in one position for too long. Stay awake, you will be less vulnerable to cold-related health problems. Use blankets, newspapers, maps, and even the removable car mats for added insulation. Avoid overexertion since cold weather puts an added strain on the heart. Unaccustomed exercise such as shoveling snow or pushing a vehicle can bring on a heart attack or make other medical conditions worse.  Shoveling Snow Shoveling snow can be a strenuous activity, particularly because cold weather can be taxing on the body. There is a potential for exhaustion, dehydration, back injuries, or heart attacks. During snow removal in addition to following the tips for avoiding cold stress, such as taking frequent breaks in warm areas, there are other precautions workers can take to avoid injuries. Workers should warm-up before the activity, scoop small amounts of snow at a time and where possible, push the snow instead of lifting it. The use of proper lifting technique is necessary to avoid back and other injuries when shoveling snow: keep the back straight, lift with the legs and do not turn or twist the body.  Using Powered Equipment like Snow Blowers It is important to make sure that powered equipment, such as snow blowers are properly grounded to protect workers from electric shocks or electrocutions. When performing maintenance or cleaning, make sure the equipment is properly guarded and is disconnected from power sources.  Snow blowers commonly cause lacerations or amputations when operators attempt to clear jams with the equipment turned on. Never attempt to clear a jam by hand. First, turn the snow blower off and wait for all moving parts to stop, and then use a long stick to clear wet snow or debris from the machine. Keep your hands and feet away from moving parts. Refuel a snow blower prior to starting the machine; do not add fuel when the equipment is running or when the engine is hot.  Clearing Snow from Roofs and Working at Heights Employers must evaluate snow removal tasks for hazards and plan how to do the work safely. Workers should be aware of the potential for unexpected hazards due to the weather conditions, for example, layers of ice can form as the environmental temperature drops, making surfaces even more slippery. A surface that is weighed down by snow must be inspected by a competent person to determine if it is structurally safe for workers to access it, because it may be at risk of collapsing. Snow covered rooftops can hide hazards such as skylights that workers can fall through. Electrical hazards may also exist from overhead power lines or snow removal equipment.  Employers can protect workers from these hazardous work conditions, for example, by using snow removal methods that do not involve workers going on roofs, when and where possible. Employers should determine the right type of equipment (ladders, aerial lifts, etc.) and personal protective equipment (personal fall arrest systems, non-slip safety boots, etc.) for the job and ensure that workers are trained on how to properly use them. For more information, see OSHA's Hazard Alert: Falls and Other Hazards to Workers Removing Snow from Rooftops and Other Elevated Surfaces.  Preventing Slips on Snow and Ice To prevent slips, trips, and falls, employers should clear walking surfaces of snow and ice, and spread deicer, as quickly as possible after a winter storm. In addition, the following precautions will help reduce the likelihood of injuries:  Wear proper footwear when walking on snow or ice is unavoidable, because it is especially treacherous. A pair of insulated and water resistant boots with good rubber treads is a must for walking during or after a winter storm. Keeping a pair of rubber over-shoes with good treads which fit over your street shoes is a good idea during the winter months. Take short steps and walk at a slower pace so you can react quickly to a change in traction, when walking on an icy or snow-covered walkway. Repairing Downed or Damaged Power Lines Repairing and/or replacing damaged power lines in severe winter weather conditions are especially hazardous. A major hazard is snow, because the moisture can reduce the insulation value of protective equipment, and could cause electrocution. In these conditions de-energized work is safer, but if energized work must be done, qualified workers and supervisors must first do a hazard analysis that includes evaluating the weather conditions and identifying how to safely do the job.  Other potential hazards include:  Electrocution by contacting downed energized power lines, or contacting objects, such as broken tree limbs, in contact with downed energized power lines. Fires caused by an energized line or equipment failure. Being struck or crushed by falling tree limbs, collapsing poles, etc. When working on downed or damaged power lines, electrical utility workers should use safe work practices, appropriate tools and equipment (including personal protective equipment (PPE)). Extra caution should be exercised when working in adverse weather conditions. Learn more at: Contact with Power Lines (OSHA Construction eTool).  Working Near Downed or Damaged power lines Assume all power lines are energized and stay clear of any downed or damaged power lines. Establish a safe distance from power lines and report any incidents to the responsible authority. Only properly-trained electrical utility workers can handle damaged power lines. Learn more at: Contact with Power Lines (OSHA Construction eTool) and Working Safely Around Downed Electrical Wires (OSHA Fact Sheet).  Removing Downed Trees Clearing downed trees is a critical job during severe winter weather conditions. It is usually urgent to remove downed trees that block public roads and damage power lines. Emergency crews are often tasked with clearing downed trees.  Potential hazards include:  Electrocution by contacting downed energized power lines or contacting broken tree limbs in contact with downed energized power lines. Learn more at: Line Clearance Tree Trimming Operations (OSHA Electric Power eTool). Falls from heights. Being injured by equipment such as chain saws (Chain Saw Safety (OSHA QuickCard™)) and chippers (Chipper Machine Safety (OSHA QuickCard™)). Workers should wear PPE that protect them from the hazards of the tree removal tasks. Workers using chainsaws and chippers to clear downed trees should use: gloves, chaps, foot protection, eye protection, fall protection, hearing protection and head protection.  Only powered equipment designed for outdoor and wet conditions should be used. Use all equipment and tools (saws, chippers, etc.) properly and for the purpose that they are designed for. Ensure that equipment is always maintained in serviceable condition and inspected before use by a knowledgeable person that can identify any problems with the equipment. Do not use equipment that is not functioning properly. Equipment must have proper guarding (as applicable); safe guards must never be bypassed. All controls and safety features must function as designed by the manufacturer. Learn more at: Tree Trimming and Removal (OSHA QuickCard™).
Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management	https://oklahoma.gov/oem/programs-and-services/preparedness/preparedness-winter-weather.html	Oklahoma	NA	English	Winter hazards	Winter Weather Preparedness With winter weather comes the need to prepare your home, automobile and family to deal with the colder temperatures, as well as the possibility for snow and ice. Before traveling make sure to prepare your vehicle. Packing blankets, emergency food and water, flashlights, a radio and cell phone with extra batteries will help you and your family, should you become stranded because of the weather.  Always heed the warnings of law enforcement and transportation officials regarding road conditions and refrain from traveling when road conditions warrant. If you must travel during a snow or ice event, allow extra time to reach your destination, and make sure you have plenty of fuel. Be particularly cautious on bridges and overpasses as they will be the first to freeze. Also, stay back at least 200 feet behind salt and sand equipment in order to stay safe.  It’s also important to remember to protect your home. Adding weather stripping and insulation, keeping furnaces clean and ready to use, and being aware of cold temperatures and vulnerable pipes that might freeze mark just some of the actions that can help prevent major and costly winter weather-related damage.  In recent years Oklahoma has been pounded with ice storms. Since 2007, ice storms were responsible for more than 55 deaths and power outages to more than 640,000 homes and businesses across the state. Infrastructure damage to cities, towns and counties alone exceeded $250 million.  Stay informed regarding hazardous winter weather conditions on NOAA All Hazards Weather Radio and on local radio and television stations. Sign up now to receive OEM’s weather alerts and receive National Weather Service (NWS) watches and warnings direct to your cell phone or other email address at https://www.ok.gov/OEM/.  Below are some additional winter weather preparedness tips. For more information on how to cope with winter weather, contact your local emergency manager.  View this Winter Storm Safety Infographic  Be Aware: Know what winter storm and blizzard watches and warnings mean. An NWS Winter Storm watch is a message indicating that conditions are favorable to a winter storm. An NWS warning indicates that a winter storm is occurring or is imminent. A blizzard warning means sustained winds or frequent gusts to 35 mph or greater and considerable falling or blowing snow are expected to prevail for a period of three hours or longer. Depend on a reliable weather information source (the Internet, NOAA Weather All Hazards Radio, local television and radio stations) for the latest weather information. Plan for a Winter Storm: Develop a Family Disaster Plan for winter storms. Discuss with your family what to do if a winter storm watch or warning is issued. Everyone should know what to do in case all family members are not together when a winter storm hits. Understand the hazards of wind chill. A strong wind combined with a temperature of just below freezing can have the same effect as a still air temperature of 35 degrees or colder. Check on family, friends and neighbors, especially the elderly. Make sure they are prepared. Don’t forget about the pets. Make sure they have good food and water supplies and a place to seek shelter. Have your car winterized by checking antifreeze, washer blades, tire pressure, etc. Extreme Cold Exposure View this Cold Exposure infographic  Prolonged exposure to the cold can cause frostbite, hypothermia, or in extreme cases, death. Infants and the elderly are most susceptible to extreme cold. Frostbite occurs when the skin becomes cold enough to actually freeze. A loss of feeling and a white or pale appearance in extremities, such as fingers, toes, ear lobes, or the nose are symptoms of frostbite. Hypothermia (low body temperature) can occur during longer periods of exposure when the body temperature drops below 95 F. A person will become disoriented, confused, and shiver uncontrollably, eventually leading to drowsiness and apparent exhaustion. In severe cases, death is possible. The following tips can help decrease the risk of cold exposure:  Wear layered clothing outdoors for better protection from the cold. Wear a cap to prevent rapid heat loss from an uncovered head. Cover exposed skin to prevent frostbite. While indoors, try to keep at least one room heated to 70 F. This is especially important for the elderly and small children to prevent hypothermia. Sleep warm with extra blankets, a warm cap, socks and layered clothing. Avoid fatigue and exhaustion during cold weather. Overexertion, such as shoveling snow or pushing a car, can strain your heart. Carry extra clothing, blankets and high energy snacks, such as cereal or candy bars in your car for protection if car stalls. Keep the gas tank near full to prevent icing. Check daily on elderly friends, relatives and neighbors who live alone. The elderly and very young should stay indoors as much as possible. Offer to shop for elderly friends and relatives. Just like in the summer with heat, it takes some time to get acclimated to cold weather. If You Must Go Out During a Winter Storm: The best way to stay safe in a snowstorm is not to be out in it. Long periods of exposure to severe cold can result in frostbite or hypothermia. It is easy to become disoriented in blowing snow.  If you go out to shovel snow, do a few stretching exercises to warm up your body. This will reduce your chances of muscle injury. Avoid overexertion, especially with activities such as shoveling heavy snow, pushing a car or walking in deep snow. Walk carefully on snowy, icy sidewalks. Slips and falls occur frequently in winter weather, resulting in painful and sometimes disabling injury. Dress in many layers, including a hat and mittens or gloves. Come inside often for warm-up breaks. If you start to shiver or get very tired, or if your nose, fingers, toes, or ear lobes start to feel numb or turn very pale, come inside right away and seek medical assistance. These are the signs of hypothermia and frostbite and need immediate attention. Let someone know your destination, your route and when you expect to arrive. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle and hang a brightly colored cloth (preferably red) on the radio antenna and raise the hood (after snow stops falling) If you must drive in a storm: Remember, the leading cause of death during winter storms is vehicle crashes. If at all possible, stay home during winter storms. If you know you will need to travel, prepare your vehicle and know how to react if you are stranded on the road.  Check your local weather, as well as the weather along your route and at your destination. Check local media for event closings and cancellations. Remember, conditions can deteriorate quickly in a winter storm. Check for weather-related road conditions through the Oklahoma Department of Transportation at okroads.org Make sure you have plenty of fuel; a good rule of thumb is to keep your fuel tank at least half full Always wear your seat belt In ice or snow, take it slow; allow ample time to reach your destination Bring a cell phone with an emergency roadside assistance number (In case of emergency, you can call the Oklahoma Highway Patrol at *55 or 911) Remember that bridges and ramps will be the first to freeze Make sure your Winter Storm Disaster Supply Kit includes: A cell phone with extra battery or two-way radio Windshield scraper and small broom for ice and snow removal Several blankets or sleeping bags Rain gear and extra sets of dry clothing, mittens, socks and a cap Non-perishable snacks like canned fruit, nuts and other high energy “munchies.” ----Include non-electric can opener if necessary. Several bottles of water. Eating snow will lower your body temperature. If necessary, melt it first. A small sack of sand or kitty litter for generating traction under wheels and a set of tire chains or traction mats. Jumper cables A first aid kit A flashlight with extra batteries A brightly colored cloth to tie to the antenna if you get stranded. Carbon Monoxide Poisoning When temperatures fall and power goes out, the possibility of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning rises as people try to stay warm. Invisible, odorless and tasteless, CO is a highly poisonous gas produced by the burning of fuel such as gasoline, natural gas, kerosene, charcoal or wood. Unvented or faulty gas and kerosene appliances have the greatest potential to produce dangerous levels of CO in a home. Smoldering or poorly vented fireplaces, slow-burning fuels such as charcoal and vehicle exhausts also are potential indoor hazards. Take these precautions:  Look at the color of the flame. A hot blue flame produces less CO and more heat than a flickering yellow flame. If you see yellow flames in your furnace or stove burner, it should be adjusted so that the flame is blue. Don’t use an unvented gas or kerosene heater in closed spaces, especially sleeping areas. Don’t use gas appliances such as an oven, range or clothes dryer to heat your home. Don’t burn charcoal inside a house, garage, vehicle or tent for heating or cooking, even in a fireplace. Look for CO exposure symptoms including headache, dizziness, weakness, sleepiness, nausea and vomiting that can progress to disorientation, coma, convulsions and death. If you suspect CO poisoning, open doors and windows, turn off gas appliances, and go outside for fresh air. Call 9-1-1 emergency medical services in severe cases. To prevent residential fires, make sure that heaters, stoves, and fireplaces are at least three feet from anything that burns. Use screens in front of fireplaces, and do not leave children alone with space heaters. Never leave candles burning when you are not at home or while you are sleeping. If a heater uses fuel like propane or kerosene, use only that kind of fuel and add more fuel only when the heater is cool. Store all fuels outside in closed metal containers. Protect Your Property: Install and check/replace batteries in smoke alarms. Make sure your home is properly insulated. If necessary insulate walls and attic. Caulk and weather-strip doors and windowsills. Install storm windows or cover windows with plastic from the inside. To keep pipes from freezing, wrap them in insulation or layers of old newspapers (Cover the newspapers with plastic to keep out moisture) Let faucets drip a little to avoid freezing. Know how to shut off water valves. Consider storing extra heating fuel. Keep safe emergency-heating equipment, such as a fireplace with wood. Always be cautious in using a portable space heater and never leave the heater on when you are not in the room or when you go to bed. If you have a generator, take the time now to complete any required maintenance.  Before using the generator, make sure you follow instructions from a licensed electrician to include proper ventilation to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.
Arizona Emergency Information Network	https://ein.az.gov/hazards/winter-weather	Pima County, Maricopa County, Coconino County	N/A	English	Winter Storm Warning, Winter Weather Advisory	Winter weather in Arizona can be harsh and unforgiving. Winter storms can range from a moderate snow over a few hours to a blizzard with blinding, wind-driven snow that lasts for several days. Many winter storms come with dangerously low temperatures and sometimes strong winds, ice, sleet and freezing rain. The winter weather's ability to knock out utility services to your home or office is a primary safety concern. Heavy snowfall and extreme cold can immobilize an entire region. While the danger from winter weather varies across the state, nearly all Arizonans are likely to face severe weather at some point. It is important to be prepared for winter weather before it strikes.   BEFORE  Winterize Your Vehicle Check antifreeze levels. Check battery and ignition systems. Battery terminals should be clean. Check brakes for wear and fluid levels. Check the exhaust system for leaks and crimped pipes and repair or replace as necessary. Carbon monoxide is deadly and usually gives no warning. Replace and keep water out of fuel and air filters by using additives and maintaining a full tank of gas. A full tank will keep the fuel line from freezing. Ensure the heater and defroster work properly. Check lights and flashing hazard lights. Check the oil level and weight. Heavier oils solidify more at low temperatures and do not lubricate as well. Ensure the thermostat works properly. Repair or replace windshield wipers equipment, and maintain proper washer fluid level. Install good winter tires with adequate tread. All-weather radial tires are usually adequate for most winter conditions. However, some jurisdictions require that to drive on their roads, vehicles must be equipped with chains or snow tires with studs. Winterize Your Home Winterize your home to extend the life of your fuel supply by insulating walls and attics, caulking and weather-stripping doors and windows, or covering windows with plastic. Maintain heating equipment and chimneys by having them cleaned and inspected every year. Insulate pipes with insulation or newspapers and plastic and allow faucets to drip a little during cold weather to avoid freezing. Running water, even at a trickle, helps prevent pipes from freezing. All fuel-burning equipment should be vented to the outside and kept clear. Keep fire extinguishers on hand, and make sure everyone in your house knows how to use them. House fires pose an additional risk, as more people turn to alternate heating sources without taking the necessary safety precautions. Learn how to shut off water valves(link is external) in case a pipe bursts.   DURING  Stay indoors during the storm. Stay off roads if at all possible. If trapped in your car, then stay inside. Avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Only use generators and grills outdoors and away from windows. Never heat your home with a gas stovetop or oven. Check on neighbors. Older adults and young children are more at risk in extreme cold. If you must drive: travel during daytime; don’t travel alone; tell other people your schedule; stay on main roads and avoid back road shortcuts. Let someone know your destination, your route, and when you expect to arrive. Watch for signs of frostbite and hypothermia(link is external) Listen to a NOAA Weather Radio(link is external) or other local news channels for critical information from the National Weather Service (NWS). Stranded in a Vehicle If a blizzard traps you in the car: Pull off the highway. Turn on hazard lights and hang a distress flag from the radio antenna or window. Stay in your vehicle where rescuers are most likely to find you. Do not walk away from your vehicle unless help or a safe structure is visible within 100 yards. Run the engine and heater about 10 minutes each hour to keep warm. When the engine is running, open a downwind window slightly for ventilation, turn on the interior light, and periodically clear snow from the exhaust pipe. This will protect you from possible carbon monoxide poisoning. Clap your hands and move your arms and legs occasionally to maintain body heat, but avoid overexertion. In extreme cold, use road maps, seat covers, and floor mats for insulation. Huddle with passengers and use your coat for a blanket. Take turns sleeping. One person should be awake at all times to look for rescue crews. Eat regularly and drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.   AFTER  Check on neighbors. Older adults and young children are more at risk in extreme cold. Avoid overexertion when shoveling snow. Overexertion can bring on a heart attack—a major cause of death in the winter. If you must shovel snow, stretch before going outside. Maintain your car’s winter emergency go kit for the remainder of the season.

The winter storms can range from a moderate amount of snowfall over a few hours to a blizzard with intense, wind-driven snow that persists for several days. These storms often bring extremely low temperatures, strong winds, ice, sleet, and freezing rain. One of the main safety concerns during winter weather is the potential for utility services to be disrupted in homes and offices. When heavy snowfall and extreme cold hit, an entire region can be left paralyzed.  While the severity of winter weather may vary across the state, it is highly likely that most Arizonans will experience severe weather conditions at some point. Therefore, it is crucial to be prepared for winter weather in advance to ensure your safety.  Before Winter Weather Know where it snows in Arizona.  Sign up for your local county or tribal emergency alerts. Create an emergency go kit for your car: Include jumper cables, sand, a flashlight, windshield scraper, battery-powered radio, warm clothes, blankets, bottled water, and non-perishable snacks. Incorporate supplies to help keep you and your family healthy, such as face coverings, hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes. Keep the gas tank full. Make a Family Communication Plan. Your family may not be together when disaster strikes, so it is important to know how you will contact one another, how you will get back together and what you will do in case of an emergency. Gather supplies in case you need to stay home for several days without power. Keep in mind each person’s specific needs, including medication. Do not forget the needs of pets. Have extra batteries for radios and flashlights. Prepare your home to keep out the cold with caulking, weather stripping, and insulation as necessary. Learn how to keep pipes from freezing. Install and test smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors with battery backups. Learn the signs of, and basic treatments for, frostbite and hypothermia.

Stay Safe During Winter Weather alert - warning Avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Only use generators and grills outdoors and away from windows. Never heat your home with a gas stovetop or oven.  Stay off roads if at all possible. If trapped in your car, then stay inside. Limit your time outside. If you need to go outside, then wear layers of warm clothing. Watch for signs of frostbite and hypothermia. Reduce the risk of a heart attack by avoiding overexertion when shoveling snow and walking in the snow. Learn the signs of, and basic treatments for, frostbite and hypothermia. Frostbite causes loss of feeling and color around the face, fingers and toes.  Signs: Numbness, white or grayish-yellow skin, firm or waxy skin. Actions: Go to a warm room. Soak in warm water. Use body heat to warm. Do not massage or use a heating pad. Hypothermia is an unusually low body temperature. A temperature below 95 degrees is an emergency.  Signs: Shivering, exhaustion, confusion, fumbling hands, memory loss, slurred speech or drowsiness. Actions: Go to a warm room. Warm the center of the body first—chest, neck, head and groin. Keep dry and wrapped up in warm blankets, including the head and neck. Generator Safety feature_mini img Generators can be helpful when the power goes out. It is important to know how use them safely to prevent carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and other hazards.  Generators and fuel should always be used outdoors and at least 20 feet away from windows, doors and attached garages. Install working carbon monoxide detectors on every level of your home. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that can kill you, your family and pets. Keep the generator dry and protected from rain or flooding. Touching a wet generator or devices connected to one can cause electrical shock. Always connect the generator to appliances with heavy-duty extension cords. Let the generator cool before refueling. Fuel spilled on hot engine parts can ignite. Follow manufacturer’s instructions carefully.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/winter/beforestorm/preparehome.html	National	2/14/2019	English	Winter Storm Warning, Winter Weather Advisory	During extremely cold weather or winter storms, staying warm and safe can be a challenge. Winter storms can bring cold temperatures, power failures, loss of communication services, and icy roads. To keep yourself and your loved ones safe, you should know how to prepare your home and your car before a winter storm hits.  Make a Plan Prepare Your Home and Car Steps to Take Before the Storm Hits Make a Plan Be prepared before a winter storm hits by planning ahead. If you are in an area prone to winter weather, be sure to create a communication and disaster plan for your family ahead of time.  Prepare Your Home and Car Weatherproof your home. Insulate any water lines that run along exterior walls so your water supply will be less likely to freeze. Caulk and weather-strip doors and windows. Insulate walls and attic. Install storm or thermal-pane windows or cover windows with plastic from the inside. Repair roof leaks and cut away tree branches that could fall on your home or other structure during a storm. Have your chimney or flue inspected each year. If you plan to use a fireplace or wood stove for emergency heating, have your chimney or flue inspected each year. Ask your local fire department to recommend an inspector or find one online.  Install a smoke detector and a battery-operated carbon monoxide detector. If you’ll be using a fireplace, wood stove, or kerosene heater, install a smoke detector and a battery-operated carbon monoxide detector near the area to be heated. Test them monthly and replace batteries twice a year. Keep a multipurpose, dry-chemical fire extinguisher nearby. All fuel-burning equipment should be vented to the outside. Each winter season have your furnace system and vent checked by a qualified technician to ensure they are functioning properly. For older adults, keep an easy-to-read thermometer inside your home. If you or a loved one are over 65 years old, place an easy-to-read thermometer in an indoor location where you will see it frequently. Our ability to feel a change in temperature decreases with age. Older adults are more susceptible to health problems caused by cold. Check the temperature of your home often during the winter months.  Create an emergency car kit. It is best to avoid traveling, but if travel is necessary, keep the following in your carexternal icon:  Cell phone, portable charger, and extra batteries Items to stay warm such as extra hats, coats, mittens, and blankets Windshield scraper Shovel Battery-powered radio with extra batteries Flashlight with extra batteries Water and snack food First aid kit with any necessary medications and a pocket knife Tow chains or rope Tire chains Canned compressed air with sealant for emergency tire repair Cat litter or sand to help tires get traction, or road salt to melt ice Booster cables with fully charged battery or jumper cables Hazard or other reflectors Bright colored flag or help signs, emergency distress flag, and/or emergency flares Road maps Waterproof matches and a can to melt snow for water  Steps to Take Before the Storm Hits Listen to weather forecasts, and check your supplies. Listen to weather forecasts regularly and check your emergency supplies, including your emergency food and water supply, whenever you are expecting a winter storm or extreme cold. Even though we can’t always predict extreme cold in advance, weather forecasts can sometimes give you several days of notice to prepare.  Bring your pets indoors. If you have pets, bring them indoors. If you cannot bring them inside, provide adequate shelter to keep them warm and make sure they have access to unfrozen water.  Get your car ready. Have maintenance service on your vehicle as often as the manufacturer recommends. In addition, every fall, do the following:  Have the radiator system serviced or check the antifreeze level yourself with an antifreeze tester. Add antifreeze as needed. Replace windshield-wiper fluid with a wintertime mixture. Make sure the tires on your car have adequate tread and air pressure. Replace any worn tires and fill low tires with air to the proper pressure recommended for your car (typically between 30-35 psi). Keep the gas tank near full to help avoid ice in the tank and fuel lines. Keep your car in good working order. Be sure to check the following: heater, defroster, brakes, brake fluid, ignition, emergency flashers, exhaust, oil, and battery.

In either place, you should have available:  Flashlight and extra batteries Battery-powered NOAA Weather Radio and portable radio to receive emergency information Extra food and water such as dried fruit, nuts, granola bars and other food requiring no cooking or refrigeration. Extra prescription medicine Baby items such as diapers and formula First-aid supplies Heating fuel: refuel before you are empty; fuel carriers may not reach you for days after a winter storm Emergency heat source: fireplace, wood stove or space heater properly ventilated to prevent a fire Fire extinguisher, smoke alarm; test smoke alarms monthly to ensure they work properly Extra pet food and warm shelter for pets Review generator safety: Never run a generator in an enclosed space Make sure your carbon monoxide detector is working correctly and that the outside vent is clear of leaves and debris. During or after the storm, make sure it is cleared of snow. Home fires are common each winter when trying to stay warm. Review ways to keep your home and loved ones safe. –In Vehicles Each year, on average, more than 5,000 people are killed and more than 418,000 are injured due to weather-related vehicle crashes. If you need to drive in snow or cold conditions, TAKE IT SLOW IN THE SNOW. Black ice can be difficult to see. If the temperature is near freezing, drive like you're on ice--you may be!  Before you leave the house, especially before a longer trip in winter, make sure all fluid levels are full and ensure that the lights, heater and windshield wipers are in proper condition. Keep your gas tank near full to avoid ice in the tank and fuel lines. Avoid traveling alone. Let someone know your timetable and primary and alternate routes. Then call 511 for the latest traffic and road incidents, including construction and weather conditions and restrictions. Every state offers this Department of Transportation service. Call before you leave; it might change your plans!  Fully check and winterize your vehicle before the winter season begins. Carry a Winter Storm Survival Kit that includes the following:  Mobile phone, charger, batteries Blankets/sleeping bags Flashlight with extra batteries First-aid kit Knife High-calorie, non-perishable food Extra clothing to keep dry Large empty can to use as emergency toilet, tissues, toilet paper and paper towels Small can and waterproof matches to melt snow for drinking water Sack of sand or cat litter for traction Shovel Windshield scraper and brush Tool kit Tow rope Battery booster cables Water container Candle and matches to provide light and in an emergency, lifesaving heat. Compass and road maps, don't depend on mobile devices with limited battery life –On the Farm, Pet Owners Move animals to sheltered areas or bring pets inside. Shelter belts, properly laid out and oriented, are better protection for cattle than confining shelters, such as sheds. Haul extra feed to nearby feeding areas. Have water available. Most animals die from dehydration in winter storms. Make sure pets have plenty of food and water and a warm shelter.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/winter/duringstorm/indoorsafety.html	National	12/22/2022	English	Winter Storm Warning, Winter Weather Advisory	Stay Safe During & After a Winter Storm  Winter storms are dangerous. They can bring cold temperatures, power failures, loss of communication services, and icy roads. This can make being outside dangerous, so you should limit your time outside. Although staying indoors as much as possible can help reduce the risk of car crashes and falls on the ice, you may also face hazards inside your home.  On This Page Stay Safe Indoors Stay Safe Outdoors Stay Safe Indoors Protect yourself and your loved ones during a winter storm. Take extra steps to make sure you heat your home safely, and follow the tips below.  Heat your home safely. If you plan to use a wood stove, fireplace, or space heater, be extremely careful. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and remember these safety tips:  Turning on the stove for heat is not safe; have at least one of the following heat sources in case the power goes out: Extra blankets, sleeping bags, and warm winter coats Fireplace that is up to code with plenty of dry firewood or a gas log fireplace Portable space heaters or kerosene heaters. Check with your local fire department to make sure that kerosene heaters are legal in your area. Use electric space heaters with automatic shut-off switches and non-glowing elements. Make sure to keep them away from any flammable materials, like curtains or blankets. Use fireplaces, wood stoves, or other combustion heaters only if they are properly vented to the outside and do not leak gas from the flue or exhaust into the indoor air space. Have your heating system serviced by a qualified technician every year. Do not burn paper in a fireplace. Make sure you have proper ventilation if you must use a kerosene heater. Use only the type of fuel your heater is designed to use—don’t substitute. Keep heat sources, like space heaters, at least 3 feet away from drapes, furniture, or bedding. Never cover your space heater. Never place a space heater on top of furniture or near water. Never leave children unattended near a space heater. Make sure that the cord of an electric space heater is not a tripping hazard, but do not run the cord under carpets or rugs. Avoid using extension cords to plug in your space heater. If your space heater has a damaged electrical cord or produces sparks, do not use it. Featured Resource Be ready for winter infographic Check out our infographic, Be Ready! Winter Weather for tips on getting your family, home, and car ready for a winter storm.  Top of Page Light your home safely. If there is a power failure:  Use battery-powered flashlights or lanterns rather than candles, if possible. Candles can lead to house fires. If you do use candles, never leave lit candles unattended. Visit What You Need to Know When the Power Goes Out Unexpectedly for more information on power outage safety. Use generators and other appliances safely. Generators should be located at least 20 feet from any window, door, or vent and in a space where rain and snow will not reach them. Protect yourself from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning by installing a battery-operated CO detector. Never using generators, gas or charcoal grills, camp stoves, or similar devices inside your home, in basements, in garages, or near windows. The fumes are deadly. Plug in appliances to the generator using individual heavy-duty, outdoor-rated extension cords. Do not use the generator or appliances if they are wet. Do not store gasoline indoors where the fumes could ignite. Conserve heat. Some gas-fueled heaters, such as vent-less gas fireplaces, require some ventilation. Otherwise, if you don’t need extra ventilation, keep as much heat as possible inside your home. Avoid unnecessarily opening doors or windows. Close off unneeded rooms. Stuff towels or rags in cracks under doors. Close draperies or cover windows with blankets at night. Make sure babies and older adults stay warm.  Babies  Infants less than one year old should never sleep in a cold room because they lose body heat more easily than adults. Follow these tips to keep your baby safe and warm during the extreme cold:  Remove any pillows or other soft bedding. These can increase the risk of smothering and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Dress babies in warmer clothing such as footed pajamas, one-piece wearable blankets, or sleep sacks. Try to maintain a warm temperature inside your home. If you’re not able to keep your home warm, make temporary arrangements to stay elsewhere. In an emergency, you can keep your baby warm using your own body heat. If you must sleep, take precautions to prevent rolling on or smothering your baby.  Older Adults  Older adults often make less body heat because of a slower metabolism and less physical activity. Check on elderly friends and neighbors often to make sure their homes are heated properly.  If you are over 65 years of age, check the temperature in your home often during extremely cold weather.  Keep a water supply. Extreme cold can cause water pipes in your home to freeze and sometimes rupture or break. When you are expecting very cold or freezing temperatures:  Leave all water taps slightly open so they drip continuously. Keep the temperature inside your home warm. Allow heated air to reach pipes. For example, open cabinet doors beneath the kitchen and bathroom sinks. If your pipes do freeze, do not thaw them with a torch. Thaw the pipes slowly with warm air from an electric hair dryer. If you cannot thaw your pipes, or the pipes have broken open, use bottled water or get water from a neighbor’s home. As an emergency measure, if no other water is available, snow can be melted for water. Bringing water to a rolling boil for one minute will kill most germs but won’t get rid of chemicals sometimes found in snow. Visit Keep Food and Water Safe After a Disaster or Emergency to learn more. Top of Page Eat well-balanced meals, and avoid alcoholic or caffeinated drinks. Eating well-balanced meals will help you stay warmer. Do not drink alcoholic or caffeinated beverages—they cause your body to lose heat faster. Instead, drink warm, sweet beverages or broth to help keep yourself warm. If you have any dietary restrictions, ask your doctor.  Stay Safe Outdoors Try to stay indoors during extremely cold weather. Make any trips outside as brief as possible, and remember these tips below to protect your health and safety.  Dress warmly and stay dry Adults and children should wear  a hat a scarf or knit mask to cover face and mouth sleeves that are snug at the wrist mittens (they are warmer than gloves) water-resistant coat and boots several layers of loose-fitting clothing Layer-up  Inner Layer: Wear fabrics that will hold more body heat and don’t absorb moisture. Wool, silk, or polypropylene will hold more body heat than cotton. Insulation Layer: An insulation layer will help you retain heat by trapping air close to your body. Natural fibers, like wool, goose down, or a fleece work best. Outer Layer: The outermost layer helps protect you from wind, rain, and snow. It should be tightly woven, and preferably water and wind resistant, to reduce loss of body heat. Three young children running through the snow wearing winter clothing Dress warmly before you go outside in cold weather.  Additional Tips:  Stay dry—wet clothing chills the body quickly. Excess sweating will cause your body to lose more heat, so remove extra layers of clothing whenever you feel too warm. Avoid getting gasoline or alcohol on your skin while de-icing and fueling your car or using a snow blower. Getting these materials on your skin will cause your body to lose a lot more heat. Do not ignore shivering—it’s an important first sign that your body is losing heat. Constant shivering is a sign that it is time to go inside. If you have asthma, breathing in cold, dry air can trigger an asthma attack.  Talk to your doctor about how you can prevent asthma attacks when outside in winter weather and remember to follow your Asthma Action Plan. Top of Page Know the signs of frostbite and hypothermia. Hypothermia  Hypothermia (abnormally low body temperature) is a dangerous condition that can happen when a person is exposed to extremely cold temperatures.  In adults, warning signs of hypothermia include shivering, exhaustion or feeling very tired, confusion, fumbling hands, memory loss, slurred speech, and drowsiness. In babies, signs include bright red, cold skin, and very low energy.  If you notice any of these signs, take the person’s temperature. If it is below 95° F, the situation is an emergency—get medical attention immediately. If you are not able to get medical help right away, try to warm the person up.   Frostbite  Frostbite is a type of injury caused by freezing. It can lead to a loss of feeling and color in the areas it affects, usually the nose, ears, cheeks, chin, fingers, and toes.  Frostbite can permanently damage the body, and severe cases can lead to amputation (removing the affected body part).  Signs of frostbite include a white or grayish-yellow skin area, skin that feels unusually firm or waxy, and numbness. If you notice signs of frostbite, seek medical care. If you are not able to get medical help right away, take steps to protect yourself and others.     cover of infographic: Avoid - Spot - Treat Frostbite and hypothermia Infographic: Avoid, Spot, Treat – Frostbite and hpothermia [PDF-4 MB]  Stay off the ice. Walking on ice is extremely dangerous. Many injuries related to cold weather happen from falls on ice-covered sidewalks, steps, driveways, and porches. Keep your steps and walkways as free of ice as possible by using rock salt or another chemical de-icing compound. Sand may also be used on walkways to reduce the risk of slipping.  Top of Page Avoid exerting yourself, and stay safe during cleanup. Cold weather puts an extra strain on the heart. If you have heart disease or high blood pressure, follow your doctor’s advice about shoveling snow or performing other hard work in the cold. Otherwise, if you have to do heavy outdoor chores, dress warmly and work slowly to avoid excess sweating. Remember, your body is already working hard just to stay warm, so don’t overdo it.  Visit Clean Up Safely After a Disaster for more information on safe cleanup after a disaster.  Be safe during outdoor activities. Let your friends and family know where you will be before you go hiking, camping, or skiing. Do not leave any areas of your skin exposed to the cold, and avoid getting wet. Try not to sweat or become too tired. Be prepared to take emergency shelter. Pack dry clothing, a two-way radio, waterproof matches, and paraffin fire starters with you. Do not use alcohol and other mood altering substances, and avoid caffeinated drinks. Avoid walking on ice. Carefully watch for signs of cold-weather health problems, like hypothermia and frostbite. Be careful while traveling. Listen for radio or television reports of travel advisories issued by the National Weather Service. Do not travel in low visibility conditions. Avoid traveling on ice-covered roads, overpasses, and bridges if at all possible. Never pour water on your windshield to remove ice or snow—this can cause your windshield to shatter. If you must travel by car, use tire chains and take a mobile phone with you. If you must travel, let someone know your destination and when you expect to arrive. Ask them to notify authorities if you are late. Check and restock the winter emergency supplies in your car before you leave. Always carry extra warm clothing and blankets with you. Don’t rely on a car to provide enough heat. The car could break down. If you get stranded: Staying in your car when stranded is often the safest choice if winter storms create poor visibility or if roadways are ice covered. These steps will increase your safety when stranded:  Tie a brightly colored cloth to the antenna as a signal to rescuers and raise the hood of the car (if it is not snowing). Move anything you need from the trunk into the passenger area. Wrap your entire body, including your head, in extra clothing, blankets, or newspapers. Stay awake. You will be less vulnerable to cold-related health problems. Run the motor (and heater) for about 10 minutes per hour, opening one window slightly to let in air. Make sure that snow is not blocking the exhaust pipe—this will reduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. As you sit, keep moving your arms and legs to improve your circulation and stay warmer. Do not eat snow because it will lower your body temperature. Huddle with other people for warmth.

Tome medidas adicionales para asegurarse de calefaccionar su casa de forma segura y siga los consejos que se presentan a continuación.  Calefaccione su casa de forma segura. Si tiene planeado usar una estufa (cocina) de leña, una chimenea o un calentador de ambiente, tenga muchísimo cuidado. Siga las instrucciones del fabricante y recuerde estos consejos de seguridad:  Prender la estufa (cocina) para calefaccionar no es seguro; tenga al menos una de estas fuentes de calor en caso de que haya un apagón: Frazadas, bolsas de dormir y chaquetas gruesas de invierno adicionales. Chimenea que cumpla con las regulaciones vigentes, con mucha leña seca o una chimenea de gas. Calentadores de ambiente portátiles o calentadores de queroseno. Consulte a su departamento de bomberos local para asegurarse de que los calentadores de queroseno sean legales en su área. Use calentadores de ambiente eléctricos con mecanismos de apagado automático y sin elementos incandescentes. Asegúrese de mantenerlos lejos de materiales inflamables como cortinas o frazadas. Use chimeneas, estufas (cocinas) de leña u otros calentadores de combustión solo si tienen un sistema adecuado de ventilación hacia el exterior y no tienen fugas de gases hacia el ambiente en interiores. Haga que un técnico calificado revise su sistema de calefacción todos los años. No queme papel en una chimenea. Asegúrese de tener una ventilación adecuada si tiene que usar un calentador de queroseno. Solo use el tipo de combustible que su calentador requiere (no use sustitutos). Mantenga las fuentes de calor como los calentadores de ambiente al menos a 3 pies de las cortinas, los muebles o la ropa de cama. Nunca cubra el calentador de ambiente. Nunca coloque un calentador de ambiente encima de un mueble o cerca de agua. Nunca deje que los niños estén cerca de un calentador de ambiente sin supervisarlos. Asegúrese de que no haya riesgo de tropezarse con el cable del calentador de ambiente eléctrico, pero tampoco lo pase por debajo de alfombras o tapetes. Evite usar extensiones para enchufar el calentador. Si su calentador tiene un cable dañado o produce chispas, no lo use.

Ir Arriba Ilumine su casa de forma segura. Si hay un corte de electricidad:  En lugar de velas, use linternas o faroles de pilas, si es posible. Las velas pueden causar incendios en las casas. Si usa velas, nunca las deje prendidas sin supervisión. Consulte Lo que necesita saber en caso de un corte inesperado de electricidad para obtener más información sobre cómo mantenerse seguro durante un apagón. Use los generadores y otros equipos eléctricos de forma segura. Los generadores deben ponerse al menos a 20 pies de cualquier ventana, puerta o rejilla de ventilación y en un lugar donde no los alcance la lluvia ni la nieve. Protéjase de la intoxicación por monóxido de carbono (CO) con la instalación de un detector de CO que funcione con pilas. Nunca use generadores, parrillas de gas o carbón, estufas (cocinas) para acampar, ni aparatos similares dentro de su casa, en sótanos, en garajes, ni cerca de ventanas. Los gases son mortales. Use cables de extensión individuales, resistentes y para uso en exteriores para enchufar los electrodomésticos al generador. No use generadores ni electrodomésticos si están mojados. No guarde gasolina dentro de su casa porque los gases se podrían encender. Conserve el calor. Algunos calentadores de gas, como las chimeneas de gas sin rejillas, requieren algo de ventilación. De otra manera, si no necesita ventilación adicional, trate de mantener el calor dentro de su casa lo más que pueda. Evite abrir ventanas y puertas cuando no sea necesario. Cierre la puerta de las habitaciones que no estén en uso. Rellene con toallas o trapos el espacio que queda debajo de las puertas. Cierre las cortinas o cubra las ventanas con frazadas por la noche. Asegúrese de que los bebés y los adultos mayores se mantengan abrigados.  Bebés  Los bebés de menos de un año nunca deben dormir en una habitación donde haga frío, ya que pierden el calor corporal más fácilmente que los adultos. Siga estos consejos para mantener a su bebé seguro y abrigado durante el tiempo de frío extremo:  Quite todas las almohadas u otra ropa blanda de cama. Pueden aumentar el riesgo de asfixia y de síndrome de muerte súbita del lactante (SMSL). Vista a los bebés con ropa más abrigada, como los pijamas con cobertura para los pies, frazadas de una sola pieza para envolverlos, o bolsas para dormir. Trate de mantener una temperatura cálida en su casa. Si no puede mantener su casa cálida, tome medidas temporales para quedarse en otro lugar. En una emergencia, usted puede mantener a su bebé abrigado usando su propio calor corporal. Si tiene que dormir, tome precauciones para prevenir voltearse sobre el bebé o asfixiarlo.  Adultos mayores  Los adultos mayores por lo general producen menos calor corporal debido a que su metabolismo es más lento y hacen menos actividad física. Esté pendiente de sus amigos o vecinos de más edad para asegurarse de que sus casas estén calefaccionadas de forma adecuada.  Si usted tiene más de 65 años de edad, revise con frecuencia la temperatura de su casa cuando haya temperaturas extremadamente frías.  Mantenga un suministro de agua. El frío extremo puede hacer que las tuberías de agua en su casa se congelen y a veces se rompan. Cuando esté esperando temperaturas muy frías o por debajo del punto de congelación:  Deje todas las llaves de agua apenas abiertas para que goteen constantemente. Mantenga una temperatura cálida dentro de su casa. Deje que el aire caliente llegue a las tuberías. Por ejemplo, abra las puertas de los gabinetes debajo del lavaplatos o lavamanos en la cocina y el baño. Si las tuberías se congelan, no las descongele con fuego. Descongele las tuberías lentamente con el aire caliente de un secador eléctrico de pelo. Si no puede descongelar las tuberías o si se rompieron, use agua embotellada u obtenga agua de la casa de un vecino. Como una medida de emergencia, si no hay otra alternativa, se puede derretir la nieve y usarla como agua. Dejar hervir el agua vigorosamente durante un minuto matará la mayoría de los microbios, pero no eliminará las sustancias químicas que se encuentran a veces en la nieve. Para obtener más información, consulte Mantenga los alimentos y el agua seguros después de un desastre natural o una emergencia. Ir Arriba Aliméntese de forma equilibrada y evite las bebidas alcohólicas o con cafeína. Mantener una alimentación equilibrada lo ayudará a conservar el calor. No tome bebidas alcohólicas ni con cafeína, ya que hacen que su cuerpo pierda el calor más rápido. En su lugar tome bebidas calientes y dulces o caldos para ayudar a mantener la temperatura corporal. Si tiene restricciones alimentarias, hable con su médico.  Manténgase seguro cuando esté afuera Trate de quedarse adentro cuando haya temperaturas extremadamente frías. Si sale, hágalo por el menor tiempo posible y recuerde los siguientes consejos para proteger su salud y mantenerse seguro:  Abríguese bien y manténgase seco Los adultos y los niños deben vestir:  Un gorro Una bufanda o máscara de lana para cubrir la cara y la boca Ropa con mangas que se ajusten en la muñeca Manoplas (son más abrigadoras que los guantes) Botas y abrigos impermeables Varias capas de ropa holgada Vístase con varias capas de ropa  Tres niños pequeños corriendo por la nieve vistiendo ropa de invierno Vístase de forma abrigada antes de salir en el tiempo frío..  Capa interior: Use telas que mantengan más calor corporal y no absorban humedad. La lana, la seda o el polipropileno mantendrán más el calor corporal que el algodón. Capa aislante: Una capa aislante lo ayudará a retener el calor al atrapar el aire cerca de su cuerpo. Las fibras naturales como la lana, las plumas de ganso o el vellón son las mejores. Capa exterior: La capa exterior lo ayuda a protegerse del viento, la lluvia y la nieve. Debe tener un tejido cerrado y, preferiblemente, ser resistente al agua y el viento, a fin de reducir la pérdida del calor corporal. Consejos adicionales:  Manténgase seco; la ropa húmeda enfría el cuerpo rápidamente. La transpiración excesiva hará que su cuerpo pierda más calor; por eso, quítese las capas de ropa adicionales cada vez que sienta mucho calor. Evite derramar gasolina o alcohol en la piel mientras descongela su vehículo y le pone gasolina o usa un soplador de nieve. Si estos materiales caen en su piel, harán que su cuerpo pierda mucho más calor. Esté pendiente si comienza a tiritar. Es un primer signo importante de que su cuerpo está perdiendo el calor. Tiritar de manera ininterrumpida es un signo de que llegó el momento de ir adentro. Ir Arriba Conozca los signos de la congelación y la hipotermia Hipotermia  La hipotermia (una temperatura corporal anormalmente baja) es una afección peligrosa que puede presentarse cuando una persona está expuesta a temperaturas extremadamente frías.  En los adultos, los signos de advertencia de la hipotermia incluyen tiritar con escalofríos, sentirse agotado o muy cansado, confusión, torpeza al usar las manos, pérdida de la memoria, habla arrastrada o enredada y somnolencia. En los bebés, los signos incluyen tener la piel fría de un tono rojo brillante, y muy poca energía.  Si nota algunos de estos signos, tómele la temperatura a esa persona. Si está por debajo de 95 °F, es una situación de emergencia; busque atención médica inmediatamente.   Congelación  La congelación es un tipo de lesión causada por el frío extremo. Puede causar la pérdida del tacto y el color en las áreas afectadas, generalmente la nariz, las orejas, las mejillas, el mentón y los dedos de los pies y las manos. La congelación puede causar daños permanentes en el cuerpo y, en algunos casos graves, amputaciones (la remoción de la parte del cuerpo afectada).  Los signos de congelación incluyen partes blancas o amarillo-grisáceas en la piel, piel inusualmente firme o lustrosa, y entumecimiento. Si usted detecta síntomas de congelación, busque atención médica.  cover of infographic: Evitar - Localizar - Tratar la congelación y la hipotermia Infografía: Evite, identifique, trate.

Muchas lesiones relacionadas con las temperaturas frías ocurren por caídas en las aceras, los escalones, las entradas para los autos y los porches cubiertos de hielo. Mantenga los escalones y los lugares por donde se camina libres de hielo tanto como sea posible, usando sal de roca u otra sustancia química para derretir el hielo. También se puede echar arena en los lugares por donde se camina, a fin de disminuir el riesgo de resbalarse.  Ir Arriba Evite esfuerzos excesivos y manténgase a salvo mientras limpia. Las temperaturas frías hacen que el corazón se esfuerce más. Si tiene una enfermedad cardiaca o presión arterial alta, siga los consejos de su médico en cuanto a quitar la nieve o hacer otros trabajos pesados en el frío. De lo contrario, si tiene que hacer tareas pesadas al aire libre, abríguese bien y trabaje despacio para evitar la transpiración excesiva. Recuerde que su cuerpo ya se está esforzando mucho solo para mantener el calor, no se exceda.  Consulte Limpie de manera segura después de un desastre para obtener más información.  Manténgase seguro mientras haga actividades al aire libre. Avíseles a sus amigos y familiares dónde estará antes de ir de excursión, a acampar o a esquiar. No deje ningún área de la piel expuesta al frío. Trate de no sudar o cansarse demasiado. Esté preparado en caso de que tenga que encontrar un refugio de emergencia. Lleve con usted ropa seca, una radio para comunicarse, fósforos a prueba de agua y pastillas de parafina para encender el fuego. No consuma alcohol ni otras sustancias que alteren su estado de ánimo y evite las bebidas con cafeína. Evite caminar sobre el hielo o mojarse. Esté muy atento a los signos de problemas de salud causados por las temperaturas frías, como la hipotermia y la congelación. Tenga cuidado al viajar. Escuche en la radio o la televisión los informes sobre las recomendaciones para los viajeros que proporciona el Servicio Nacional de Meteorologíaexternal icon. No viaje en condiciones de poca visibilidad. Si es posible, evite viajar en caminos, pasos elevados y puentes cubiertos de hielo. Nunca eche agua en su parabrisas para quitar el hielo o la nieve ya que podría romperse. Si tiene que viajar en auto, use cadenas en los neumáticos y lleve su teléfono celular. Si tiene que viajar, avísele a alguien hacia dónde va y a qué hora tiene previsto llegar. Pídale a alguien que notifique a las autoridades en caso de que no haya llegado a la hora prevista. Antes de salir, revise los suministros de emergencia para el invierno en su auto y repóngalos en caso de que sea necesario. Siempre lleve ropa abrigada y frazadas adicionales. No dependa del auto para darle suficiente calor. El auto podría dejar de funcionar. Si se queda varado: Permanecer en su auto en caso de quedarse varado es la opción más segura si las tormentas invernales hacen que haya poca visibilidad o si las carreteras están cubiertas de hielo. Estas medidas le proporcionarán mayor seguridad en caso de quedarse varado:  Amarre un trapo de un color brillante en la antena como señal para los socorristas y levante el capó del auto (si no está nevando). Saque del baúl todo lo que necesite y póngalo en el asiento de pasajero. Envuelva todo su cuerpo, incluso la cabeza, con ropa extra, frazadas o periódicos. Manténgase despierto. Así será menos vulnerable a los problemas de salud asociados a las temperaturas frías. Prenda el motor (y la calefacción) por lo menos durante 10 minutos cada hora y abra un poco una ventana para que entre aire fresco. Asegúrese de que la nieve no esté bloqueando el tubo de escape; de esa manera se reducirá el riesgo de intoxicación por monóxido de carbono. Mientras está sentado, mueva los brazos y las piernas para mejorar la circulación y mantener el calor. No coma nieve, ya que esto reducirá la temperatura corporal. Acérquese a otras personas para mantener el calor. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/winter/staysafe/hypothermia.html	National	2/18/2019	English	Winter Storm Warning, Winter Weather Advisory	Prevent Hypothermia & Frostbite Hypothermia (abnormally low body temperature) and frostbite are both dangerous conditions that can happen when a person is exposed to extremely cold temperatures. Stay safe this winter by learning more about hypothermia and frostbite, including who is most at risk, signs and symptoms, and what to do if someone develops hypothermia or frostbite.  On This Page Hypothermia Frostbite  Hypothermia What is hypothermia? Hypothermia is caused by prolonged exposures to very cold temperatures. When exposed to cold temperatures, your body begins to lose heat faster than it’s produced. Lengthy exposures will eventually use up your body’s stored energy, which leads to lower body temperature. Body temperature that is too low affects the brain, making the victim unable to think clearly or move well. This makes hypothermia especially dangerous, because a person may not know that it’s happening and won’t be able to do anything about it. While hypothermia is most likely at very cold temperatures, it can occur even at cool temperatures (above 40°F) if a person becomes chilled from rain, sweat, or submersion in cold water. Who’s most at risk? Victims of hypothermia are often:  Older adults with inadequate food, clothing, or heating Babies sleeping in cold bedrooms People who remain outdoors for long periods—the homeless, hikers, hunters, etc. People who drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. What are the signs and symptoms of hypothermia? The following are warnings signs of hypothermia:  Adults:  Shivering Exhaustion or feeling very tired Confusion Fumbling hands Memory loss Slurred speech Drowsiness Babies:  bright red, cold skin very low energy hypothermia and frostbite infographic Infographic: Avoid Spot, Treat – Frostbite and Hypothermia  pdf icon[PDF - 4 MB] Don’t wait – take action Hypothermia is a medical emergency. If you notice any of the above signs, take the person’s temperature. If it is below 95° F, get medical attention immediately!  If you are not able to get medical help right away, try to warm the person up.  Get the person into a warm room or shelter. Remove any wet clothing the person is wearing. Warm the center of the person’s body—chest, neck, head, and groin—using an electric blanket, if available. You can also use skin-to-skin contact under loose, dry layers of blankets, clothing, towels, or sheets. Warm drinks can help increase body temperature, but do not give alcoholic drinks. Do not try to give beverages to an unconscious person. After body temperature has increased, keep the person dry and wrap their body, including their head and neck, in a warm blanket. Get the person proper medical attention as soon as possible. A person with severe hypothermia may be unconscious and may not seem to have a pulse or to be breathing. In this case, handle the person gently, and get emergency assistance immediately.  Perform CPR, even if the person appears dead. CPR should continue until the person responds or medical aid becomes available. Keep warming the person while performing CPR. In some cases, hypothermia victims who appear to be dead can be successfully resuscitated. Top of Page  Frostbite What is frostbite? Frostbite is a type of injury caused by freezing. It leads to a loss of feeling and color in the areas it affects, usually extremities such as the nose, ears, cheeks, chin, fingers, and toes. Frostbite can permanently damage the body, and severe cases can lead to amputation (removing the affected body part).  Who’s most at risk? You may have a greater chance of developing frostbite if you  have poor blood circulation are not properly dressed for extremely cold temperatures Man warming his cold hands. What are the signs and symptoms of frostbite? If you notice redness or pain in any skin area, get out of the cold or protect any exposed skin—frostbite may be beginning. Any of the following signs may point to frostbite:  A white or grayish-yellow skin area Skin that feels unusually firm or waxy Numbness A person who has frostbite may not know they have it until someone else points it out because the frozen parts of their body are numb.  Don’t wait—take action! If you notice signs of frostbite on yourself or someone else, seek medical care. Check to see if the person is also showing signs of hypothermia. Hypothermia is a more serious condition and requires emergency medical care.  If (1) a person shows signs of frostbite, but no signs of hypothermia and (2) immediate medical care is not available, do the following:  Get the person into a warm room as soon as possible. Unless absolutely necessary, do not walk on feet or toes that show signs of frostbite—this increases the damage. Do not rub the frostbitten area with snow or massage it at all. This can cause more damage. Put the areas affected by frostbite in warm—not hot—water (the temperature should be comfortable to the touch for unaffected parts of the body). If warm water is not available, warm the affected area using body heat. For example, you can use the heat of an armpit to warm frostbitten fingers. Do not use a heating pad, heat lamp, or the heat of a stove, fireplace, or radiator for warming. Affected areas are numb and can easily burn. Don’t substitute these steps for proper medical care. Frostbite should be checked by a health care provider. And remember, Hypothermia is a medical emergency and immediate medical care is necessary.  Be prepared. Taking a first aid or emergency resuscitation (CPR) course is a good way to prepare for health problems related to cold weather. Knowing what to do is an important part of protecting your health and the health of others.  Being prepared is your best defense against having to deal with extremely cold weather. By preparing your home and car ahead of winter storms or other winter emergencies, and by taking safety precautions during extremely cold weather, you can reduce your risk of developing health problems related to cold weather.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	https://www.cdc.gov/es/disasters/winter/staysafe/hypothermia.html	National	2/24/2021	Spanish	Winter Storm Warning, Winter Weather Advisory	Prevenga la hipotermia y la congelación  La hipotermia (una temperatura corporal anormalmente baja) y la congelación son afecciones peligrosas que pueden presentarse cuando una persona está expuesta a temperaturas extremadamente frías. Manténgase seguro este invierno al informarse más sobre la hipotermia y la congelación, quiénes tienen un riesgo mayor, cuáles son los signos y síntomas, y qué hacer si alguien presenta estas afecciones.  On This Page Hipotermia Congelación  Hipotermia ¿Qué es la hipotermia? La hipotermia es causada por exposiciones prolongadas a temperaturas muy frías. Cuando está expuesto a temperaturas frías, su cuerpo comienza a perder calor más rápido de lo que lo produce. Las exposiciones prolongadas harán que se agote la energía que su cuerpo tiene almacenada, lo que lleva a una temperatura corporal más baja. Una temperatura corporal demasiado baja afecta el cerebro y hace que la víctima no pueda pensar de forma clara ni moverse normalmente. Esto hace a la hipotermia especialmente peligrosa, ya que la persona podría no saber lo que está pasando y no podrá tomar ninguna medida. Si bien la hipotermia es más común en las temperaturas muy frías, puede ocurrir incluso en temperaturas no tan frías (por encima de los 40 °F) si una persona se enfría con la lluvia, la transpiración o por la inmersión en aguas frías. ¿Quiénes tienen mayor riesgo? Las víctimas de la hipotermia muchas veces son:  Adultos mayores sin alimentación, vestimenta o calefacción adecuadas. Bebés que duermen en habitaciones frías. Personas que permanecen en exteriores durante periodos largos, como quienes no tienen dónde vivir, los excursionistas, los cazadores, etc. Personas que beben alcohol o consumen drogas ilícitas. ¿Cuáles son los signos y síntomas de la hipotermia? Los siguientes son signos de advertencia de hipotermia:  Adultos:  Tiritar Sentirse agotado o muy cansado Confusión Torpeza con las manos Pérdida de la memoria Habla arrastrada o enredada Somnolencia Bebés:  Piel fría de un tono rojo brillante Muy poca energía Gráfica de hipotermia y congelación Infografía: Evite, identifique, trate. La congelación y la hipotermia   pdf icon[PDF - 4 MB] No espere. Tome medidas La hipotermia es una emergencia médica. Si nota algunos de estos signos, tómele la temperatura a esa persona. Si está por debajo de 95 °F, ¡busque atención médica inmediatamente!  Si no puede conseguir atención médica inmediatamente, trate de que la persona recupere el calor corporal.  Lleve a la persona a una habitación o un refugio cálidos. Quítele todas las prendas mojadas que tenga puestas. Caliente la parte central del cuerpo primero (pecho, cuello, cabeza e ingle) con una frazada eléctrica, si tiene una disponible. También puede darle calor mediante el contacto directo con su piel por debajo de capas secas y sueltas de frazadas, ropa, toallas o sábanas. Las bebidas calientes pueden ayudar a aumentar la temperatura del cuerpo, pero no le dé bebidas alcohólicas. No intente darle bebidas a una persona inconsciente. Después que haya aumentado la temperatura corporal, mantenga a la persona seca y envuélvale el cuerpo, incluso la cabeza y el cuello, con una frazada abrigada. Consígale atención médica adecuada lo más pronto posible. Una persona con hipotermia grave podría estar inconsciente y podría parecer que no tiene pulso ni respira. En este caso, sea muy cuidadoso al asistir a la persona y busque asistencia médica de inmediato.  Hágale reanimación cardiopulmonar (RCP) aunque parezca que la persona está muerta. La RCP debe continuar hasta que la persona responda o haya asistencia médica disponible. Continúe dándole calor a la persona mientras sigue con la RCP. En algunos casos, la víctimas de hipotermia que parecen estar muertas pueden ser reanimadas. Ir Arriba  Congelación ¿Qué es la congelación? La congelación es un tipo de lesión causada por el frío extremo. Provoca la pérdida del tacto y el color en las áreas afectadas, generalmente la nariz, las orejas, las mejillas, el mentón y los dedos de los pies y las manos. La congelación puede causar daños permanentes en el cuerpo y, en algunos casos graves, amputaciones (la remoción de la parte del cuerpo afectada).  ¿Quiénes tienen mayor riesgo? Usted puede tener mayor probabilidad de presentar congelación en los siguientes casos:  Tiene mala circulación sanguínea. No está vestido adecuadamente para las temperaturas extremadamente frías. Un hombre calentándose las manos frías. ¿Cuáles son los signos y síntomas de la congelación? Si nota enrojecimiento o dolor en cualquier área de la piel, resguárdese del frío o proteja la piel descubierta, ya que puede que esté comenzando la congelación. Cualquiera de los siguientes signos pueden indicar congelación:  Partes blancas o amarillo-grisáceas en la piel Piel que se siente excepcionalmente firme o lustrosa Entumecimiento Una persona con congelación podría no saber que la tiene hasta que alguien se lo señale, debido a que las partes congeladas del cuerpo están entumecidas.  No espere. ¡Tome medidas! Si nota signos de congelación en usted mismo o en otra persona, busque atención médica. Vea si la persona también tiene signos de hipotermia. La hipotermia es una afección más grave y requiere atención médica de emergencia.  Si (1) una persona presenta signos de congelación, pero no signos de hipotermia y (2) si no hay atención médica disponible inmediatamente, haga lo siguiente:  Lleve a la persona a una habitación cálida lo antes posible. A menos que sea absolutamente necesario, no deje que la persona camine si tiene los pies o dedos con signos de congelación, ya que esto aumenta el daño. No frote con nieve el área congelada ni la masajee en lo absoluto. Esto podría causar más daño. Sumerja las áreas afectadas por la congelación en agua tibia, pero no caliente (la temperatura debe ser cómoda al tacto para las partes del cuerpo que no estén afectadas). Si no hay agua tibia disponible, caliente el área afectada con el calor corporal. Por ejemplo, puede usar el calor de una axila para calentar los dedos con congelación. No use una almohadilla térmica, lámpara de calor ni el calor de una estufa (cocina), chimenea o radiador para dar calor. Las áreas afectadas están entumecidas y se pueden quemar con facilidad. No haga que estas medidas sustituyan la atención médica adecuada.  Un proveedor de atención médica debe atender los casos de congelación. Y recuerde: la hipotermia es una emergencia médica y es necesario tener atención médica inmediata.  Esté preparado. Hacer un curso de primeros auxilios o de reanimación cardiopulmonar (RCP) es una buena manera de prepararse para los problemas de salud relacionados con el tiempo frío. Saber qué hacer es importante para proteger su salud y la salud de las otras personas.  Estar preparado es su mejor protección contra las temperaturas extremadamente frías. Al preparar su casa y su auto antes de las tormentas invernales u otras emergencias del invierno, y al tomar precauciones de seguridad durante el tiempo extremadamente frío, usted puede reducir el riesgo de presentar problemas de salud relacionados con las temperaturas frías.

Las tormentas invernales pueden traer temperaturas frías, apagones, cortes en los servicios de comunicación y calles y carreteras cubiertas de hielo. Para mantenerse y mantener a sus seres queridos seguros, usted debe saber cómo preparar su casa y su auto antes de que llegue una tormenta invernal.  On This Page Haga un plan Prepare su casa y su auto Medidas que se deben tomar antes de que llegue la tormenta Haga un plan Esté preparado mediante la planificación antes de que llegue una tormenta invernal. Si usted está en un área afectada con frecuencia por el tiempo invernal, asegúrese de crear un plan de comunicación y de respuesta a los desastres por adelantado para su familia.  Ir Arriba Prepare su casa y su auto Impermeabilice su casa. Aísle todas las tuberías de agua ubicadas a lo largo de paredes que den al exterior para reducir la probabilidad de que su suministro de agua se congele. Instale masilla alrededor de las puertas y ventanas, y póngales burletes. Instale material aislante en las paredes y el ático. Instale contraventanas o ventanas aisladas térmicamente, o cubra las ventanas con plástico desde adentro. Repare las goteras que haya en el techo y corte las ramas de árboles que podrían caer sobre su casa u otra estructura durante una tormenta. Haga revisar la chimenea o la salida de humo cada año. Si tiene planeado usar una chimenea o una estufa (cocina) de leña como sistema de calefacción durante emergencias, haga revisar la chimenea o la salida de humo cada año. Pídale al departamento de bomberos local que recomiende un inspector o encuentre uno en línea.  Recurso destacado Cover of infographic: ¡Estar listo! Clima invernal Vea nuestra infografía ¡Prepárese! Tiempo invernal para obtener consejos sobre cómo preparar a su familia, casa y auto para una tormenta invernal.  Instale un detector de humo y un detector de monóxido de carbono que funcione con pilas. Si va a usar una chimenea, una estufa (cocina) de leña o un calentador que funcione con queroseno, instale un detector de humo y un detector de monóxido de carbono que funcione con pilas cerca del área que vaya a calentar. Revíselos una vez al mes y cambie las pilas dos veces al año. Mantenga cerca un extinguidor de incendios multiuso que funcione con agentes químicos secos. Todos los aparatos que quemen combustible deben tener ventilación hacia el exterior. Haga que cada temporada de invierno un técnico calificado revise su sistema de caldera y rejillas de ventilación para asegurarse de que funcionen de forma adecuada. Adultos mayores: mantengan en su casa un termómetro que sea fácil de leer. Si usted o un ser querido tiene más de 65 años de edad, ponga un termómetro fácil de leer en un lugar dentro de la casa donde lo vea con frecuencia. Nuestra capacidad de sentir un cambio en la temperatura disminuye con la edad. Los adultos mayores son más susceptibles a los problemas de salud causados por el frío. Revise la temperatura de su casa con frecuencia durante los meses de invierno.  Prepare un kit de emergencias para tener en el auto. Es mejor evitar los viajes, pero si es necesario viajar, mantenga los siguientes artículos en su autoexternal icon:  Teléfono celular, cargador portátil y baterías adicionales Artículos para mantenerse abrigado, como gorros adicionales, chaquetas, manoplas (guantes sin separación para los dedos) y frazadas Raspador de hielo para parabrisas Pala Radio que funcione con pilas y pilas adicionales Linterna con pilas adicionales Agua y refrigerios Kit de primeros auxilios con todos los medicamentos necesarios y un cuchillo de bolsillo Cadenas o cuerdas para remolcar Cadenas para los neumáticos Lata de aire comprimido con sellador para la reparación temporal de neumáticos Arena para gatos o arena común para ayudar a que los neumáticos tengan tracción, o sal para echar en el camino y derretir el hielo Cables de emergencia con una batería totalmente cargada o cables de arranque Reflectores de emergencia Bandera de color brillante o carteles para pedir ayuda, bandera para indicar emergencia/peligro o bengalas de emergencia Mapas de ruta Una lata y fósforos a prueba de agua para derretir la nieve y obtener agua Ir Arriba Medidas que se deben tomar antes de que llegue la tormenta Escuche los pronósticos del tiempo y revise sus suministros. Escuche los pronósticos del tiempo regularmente y revise sus suministros para emergencias, como su suministro de agua y alimentos, cuando esté esperando una tormenta invernal o tiempo frío extremo. Si bien no siempre podemos predecir cuándo habrá tiempo frío extremo, los pronósticos del tiempo a veces pueden darle varios días de aviso para prepararse.  Entre a las mascotas. Si tiene mascotas, éntrelas a la casa. Si no puede entrarlas a la casa, proporcióneles un refugio adecuado para que se mantengan a una temperatura cálida y asegúrese de que tengan agua que no esté congelada.  Prepare el auto. Lleve su vehículo para que le hagan el mantenimiento según las recomendaciones del fabricante. Además, cada otoño haga lo siguiente:  Haga revisar el radiador o revise usted mismo el nivel del anticongelante con un medidor. Añada anticongelante si lo necesita. Remplace el líquido del limpiaparabrisas con una mezcla especial para el invierno. Asegúrese de que los neumáticos de su auto no estén gastados y que tengan la presión de aire adecuada. Remplace los neumáticos gastados y ponga aire a los que estén bajos hasta el nivel de presión adecuado que se recomiende para su auto (generalmente entre 30 y 35 psi, o libras por pulgada cuadrada). Mantenga el tanque de gasolina casi lleno para evitar que se forme hielo en el tanque o en las mangueras. Mantenga el auto en buenas condiciones de funcionamiento. Asegúrese de revisar lo siguiente: sistema de calefacción, desempañador/descongelador, frenos, líquido para frenos, arranque, luces intermitentes de emergencias, tubo de escape, aceite y batería.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/coldstress/recommendations.html	National	6/6/2018	English	Winter Storm Warning, Winter Weather Advisory	Cold Stress – Recommendations Recommendations for Employers Employers should take the following steps to protect workers from cold stress:  Schedule maintenance and repair jobs in cold areas for warmer months. Schedule cold jobs for the warmer part of the day. Reduce the physical demands of workers. Use relief workers or assign extra workers for long, demanding jobs. Provide warm liquids to workers. Provide warm areas for use during break periods. Monitor workers who are at risk of cold stress. Provide cold stress training that includes information about: Worker risk Prevention Symptoms The importance of monitoring yourself and coworkers for symptoms Treatment Personal protective equipment Recommendations for Workers Workers should avoid exposure to extremely cold temperatures when possible. When cold environments or temperatures cannot be avoided, workers should follow these recommendations to protect themselves from cold stress:  Wear appropriate clothing. Wear several layers of loose clothing. Layering provides better insulation. Tight clothing reduces blood circulation. Warm blood needs to be circulated to the extremities. When choosing clothing, be aware that some clothing may restrict movement resulting in a hazardous situation. Make sure to protect the ears, face, hands and feet in extremely cold weather. Boots should be waterproof and insulated. Wear a hat; it will keep your whole body warmer. (Hats reduce the amount of body heat that escapes from your head.) Move into warm locations during work breaks; limit the amount of time outside on extremely cold days. Carry cold weather gear, such as extra socks, gloves, hats, jacket, blankets, a change of clothes and a thermos of hot liquid. Include a thermometer and chemical hot packs in your first aid kit. Avoid touching cold metal surfaces with bare skin. Monitor your physical condition and that of your coworkers. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/cofacts.html	National	9/27/2017	English	Winter Storm Warning, Winter Weather Advisory	Preventing Carbon Monoxide Poisoning After an Emergency HIGHLIGHTS Generators, grills, camp stoves, or other gasoline, propane, natural gas, or charcoal-burning devices should never be used inside a home, basement, garage, or camper – or even outside near an open window. Every home should have at least one working carbon monoxide detector. The detector’s batteries should be checked at least twice annually, at the same time smoke detector batteries are checked. Important CO Poisoning Prevention Tips Gas-Powered Generator Never use a gas range or oven to heat a home. Never leave the motor running in a vehicle parked in an enclosed or partially enclosed space, such as a garage. Never use a generator, pressure washer, or any gasoline-powered engine inside your home, basement, or garage or less than 20 feet from any window, door, or vent. Use an extension cord that is more than 20 feet long to keep the generator at a safe distance. When using a generator, use a battery-powered or battery backup CO detector in your home. Never run a generator, pressure washer, or any gasoline-powered engine inside a basement, garage, or other enclosed structure, even if the doors or windows are open, unless the equipment is professionally installed and vented. Keep vents and flues free of debris, especially if winds are high. Flying debris can block ventilation lines. Never use a charcoal grill, hibachi, lantern, or portable camping stove inside a home, tent, or camper. If conditions are too hot or too cold, seek shelter with friends or at a community shelter. If CO poisoning is suspected, call 911 or your local Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 or consult a health care professional right away. Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas that can cause sudden illness and death if inhaled. When power outages occur during emergencies such as hurricanes or winter storms, the use of alternative sources of fuel or electricity for heating, cooling, or cooking can cause CO to build up in a home, garage, or camper and to poison the people and animals inside.  Every year, more than 400 people die in the U. S. from accidental non-fire related CO poisoning. CO is found in combustion fumes, such as those produced by small gasoline engines, stoves, generators, lanterns, and gas ranges, or by burning charcoal and wood. CO from these sources can build up in enclosed or partially enclosed spaces. People and animals in these spaces can be poisoned and can die from breathing CO.  How to Recognize CO Poisoning Exposure to CO can cause loss of consciousness and death. The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. People who are sleeping or who have been drinking alcohol can die from CO poisoning before ever having symptoms.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	https://www.cdc.gov/es/disasters/cofacts.html	National	9/5/2017	Spanish	Winter Storm Warning, Winter Weather Advisory	Prevención de las intoxicaciones por monóxido de carbono después de una emergencia Puntos importantes Los generadores, parrillas, estufas (cocinas) de campamento y otros aparatos que funcionan con gasolina, gas propano, gas natural o carbón nunca se deben usar dentro de la casa, el sótano, el garaje, o una casa rodante para acampar, y ni siquiera afuera cerca de una ventana abierta. Todas las casas deben tener por lo menos un detector de monóxido de carbono que funcione. Las baterías del detector deben revisarse por lo menos dos veces al año, al mismo tiempo que se revisan las baterías del detector de humo. El monóxido de carbono (CO) es un gas inodoro e incoloro que puede causar enfermedad y muerte repentinas si se inhala. Cuando se producen cortes de electricidad durante emergencias, como huracanes o tormentas invernales, el uso de fuentes alternativas de combustibles o electricidad para calentar o enfriar la casa o cocinar puede producir una acumulación de monóxido de carbono en casas, garajes o casas rodantes para acampar, e intoxicar a las personas y a los animales que estén adentro.  Cada año, al menos 400 personas mueren en los Estados Unidos por intoxicación accidental con monóxido de carbono no relacionada con incendios. El monóxido de carbono se encuentra en gases de combustión, como los que se producen al usar motores pequeños a gasolina, cocinas, generadores, linternas y estufas de gas, o al quemar carbón vegetal y madera. El monóxido de carbono de esas fuentes puede acumularse en espacios cerrados o semicerrados. Las personas y los animales que estén en estos espacios pueden intoxicarse y morir al inhalar el CO.  Cómo reconocer la intoxicación por CO La exposición al monóxido de carbono puede provocar la pérdida del conocimiento y la muerte. Los síntomas más comunes de la intoxicación por monóxido de carbono son dolor de cabeza, mareo, debilidad, náuseas, vómitos, dolor en el pecho y confusión. Las personas que están durmiendo o que han estado tomando bebidas alcohólicas pueden morir de intoxicación por monóxido de carbono antes de tener algún síntoma.  Consejos importantes para prevenir la intoxicación por CO Gas-Powered Generator  Nunca use estufas ni hornos a gas para calentar una casa. Nunca deje en marcha el motor de un vehículo estacionado en un lugar cerrado o parcialmente cerrado como, por ejemplo, un garaje. Nunca use un generador, una máquina de lavar a presión ni un motor a gasolina dentro de su casa, sótano o garaje, ni a menos de 20 pies de las ventanas, puertas o salidas de aire. Cuando utilice un generador, use un detector de monóxido de carbono que funcione con pilas o pilas de reserva. Nunca haga funcionar un generador, una máquina de lavar a presión ni ningún motor a gasolina dentro de un sótano, garaje u otra estructura cerrada aun si las puertas o ventanas están abiertas, a menos que un profesional haya instalado el equipo y colocado el conducto de ventilación. Mantenga las salidas de aire y los ductos libres de desechos, especialmente si hay vientos fuertes. Los desechos que son levantados por el aire pueden obstruir las líneas de ventilación. Nunca use una parrilla a carbón o de tipo hibachi, una linterna o una estufa portátil (de las que se usan para acampar) dentro de una casa, tienda de campaña o casa rodante. Si hace demasiado calor o demasiado frío, busque refugio con amigos o en un albergue comunitario. Si sospecha que ocurrió una intoxicación con monóxido de carbono, llame al 911 o al centro local de control de intoxicaciones al 1-800-222-1222, o consulte a un profesional de atención médica inmediatamente.
